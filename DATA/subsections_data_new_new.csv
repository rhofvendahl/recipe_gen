“I love to grill asparagus simply and dress it with a Meyer lemon vinaigrette and serve it with some nice beets, goat cheese, and greens. We also make an asparagus pizza that people love. The asparagus is seasoned with olive oil, lemon zest, salt, and pepper and we let it sit to drain off some of its liquid so it won’t make the dough too soggy. Then we add some raw spring onions and raw green garlic, a little Fontina, feta, or Asiago cheese, and chili flakes, and put it on the dough. People are happy. I love to make asparagus with spring peas and fava beans in pasta or in a farro risotto.”

AVOCADO


Season: spring–summer



Flavor: buttery in flavor and texture, with fruity and nutty notes



Volume: quiet



What it is: technically a fruit



Nutritional profile: 77% fat / 19% carbs / 4% protein



Calories: 325 per avocado (raw)



Protein: 4 grams



Techniques: Always serve raw, as cooking makes avocados taste bitter. Mash into guacamole, hummus, or sandwich spreads, or slice for salads.



Tips: Haas avocados are the smaller, dark green, firm variety (more flavorful, and better for guacamole), while Florida avocados are larger and brighter green (and they can sometimes be watery). Use avocados to add richness to a dish, whether a dip or spread or even a dessert.

“Avocados are key vegetables for raw foodists. They’re meaty and creamy at the same time, and versatile enough to be used in salad dressings, soups, and wraps.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“I love avocados and eat one every day. In one of my favorite salads, the richness of avocado is balanced by the acidity of tomato and the sweetness of watermelon. And avocados are versatile; as a pastry chef, I even use them in my chocolate mousse.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Mashed avocado on bread is like the PB&J of Jamaica. After my friends and I played soccer, we’d raid the cupboard for bread and climb the tree in my backyard for ‘pears,’ as we call them there, to eat on the bread, maybe with just a little salt. Their flavor is so fresh and bright.”

Calories: 100 per 1-ounce serving (yields about ½ cup)



Protein: 3 grams



Techniques: boil, pressure-cook, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Soak overnight before cooking. Cook presoaked whole barley about 35–40 minutes or longer, covered. If not presoaked, cook about 75 minutes, until tender. (Note: Quick-cooking barley takes only 10–15 minutes.)



Ratio: 1:3 (1 part barley to 3 parts cooking liquid)



Tips: For a deeper flavor, toast barley before soaking and cooking. For maximum nutrition, opt for hulled barley (which has an extra layer of fiber-rich bran), versus pearl barley (which has its outer husk removed). Try barley flakes instead of rolled oats in breakfast cereals.

BARLEY MALT


Flavor: sweet to very sweet, with notes of caramel, honey, malt, and/or molasses, and the thick, sticky, syrupy texture of molasses (syrup)



Volume: quiet (powder)–moderate/loud (syrup)



What it is: sweetener



Tips: Barley malt powder can be substituted for sugar. Barley malt syrup can be substituted for brown rice syrup, honey, or molasses. Select organic 100-percent barley malt syrup.

“Barley malt syrup is a great liquid sweetener I’ll use to sweeten desserts like custards, or when making candied nuts. Its flavor is distinctive—it’s already caramelized, almost like a great Madeira or sherry. I use it in a dessert based on beer and pretzels, where it plays against the maltiness of the beer.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





BARLEY, PEARL (or PEARLED)


Flavor: slightly sweet, with notes of nuts, and a soft, chewy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: grain (not whole)

Calories: 195 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 4 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer



Timing: Cook about 30–75 minutes, until tender.



Ratio: 1: 2 ½–3 ½ (1 cup barley to 2 ½–3 ½ cups cooking liquid)



Tip: Opt for whole-grain barley (which is higher in fiber; see BARLEY) when you have the extra time to cook it; otherwise, faster-cooking pearl barley (which doesn’t require presoaking) will do.

BEANS—IN GENERAL (or MIXED)


What they are: legumes



Techniques: Always cook thoroughly.



Timing: Most beans require anywhere from a half-hour to two hours to cook, depending on the type of bean and length of presoaking.



Tips: Soak dried beans overnight (or for 8–10 hours) before cooking. Drain and rinse the beans before cooking in fresh water for about 1–3 hours, depending on the type of bean. While you can add alliums (e.g., garlic, onions) or herbs (e.g., parsley, thyme) during the cooking process, do not add acid (e.g., lemon, tomato, vinegar) during cooking; acids may interfere with the cooking process. If you don’t buy salt-free canned beans, rinse before using. Dried beans will typically yield three times their quantity in cooked beans (i.e., ⅓ cup dried beans = 1 cup cooked beans). Certain compatible seasonings also aid in the digestion of beans, e.g., asafoetida, cumin, fennel, ginger, kombu, savory.

“We only cook our beans in clay pots, called olla de barro, because they taste so much better cooked that way. When we first experimented, we soaked the beans overnight, then cooked half in a traditional metal pot and the other half in a clay pot [which transmits heat more gently, allowing flavors to develop more slowly but with greater depth]. You could absolutely taste the difference.”

“Our beet tartare is a play on beef tartare, so I thought about my associations with both tartare and with beets. The tartare inspired the capers, shallots, and [vegan] Worcestershire sauce, while the beets inspired the dill and orange. Quail eggs are a lighter, more delicate take on traditional egg yolks.”

“Many people say they don’t like the flavor of bell peppers, but I think they actually don’t like raw bell peppers. Their season in California is short [September–October], but red and yellow peppers are wonderful grilled, roasted, or sautéed in curries and soups—and yes, even raw when served with hummus. They’re easy to peel if you oven-roast them, then put them in a covered bowl to steam—the peel will come right off.”

“The way Jean-Georges Vongerichten thinks about flavors is exceptional. I made his recipe for Brussels sprouts [with toasted pecans and avocado] that appeared in Food and Wine, and it was amazingly good.”

—SELMA MIRIAM, BLOODROOT (BRIDGEPORT, CT)




“In mainstream restaurants, you’ll inevitably see Brussels sprouts served with bacon. We serve them with smoked tofu, whose smokiness serves as the ‘bacon,’ accented by the sweetness of orange juice and a hint of agave plus the umami of miso.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)

“Cacao, which is essentially unprocessed chocolate, is one of nature’s most powerful superfoods. In addition to its nutritional benefits, it is a stimulant without negative side effects. I use cacao nibs or powder or pods for our chocolate frostings and truffles. I’ll substitute raw carob powder if I want a similar flavor with no stimulants.”

“Theo Schoenegger [of Sinatra Restaurant in Las Vegas] is awesome and is one of the best Italian chefs working in America. He is also one of the most open-minded people I have worked with. He likes to eat healthy and acknowledges that Americans eat far too much meat and animal protein three times a day / seven days a week, so he was digging the vegan stuff I was showing him. Together, we created a vegan agnolotti and a vegan Caesar salad. For Caesar salad, to add the briny flavor you need, I use capers instead of anchovies—and people love it.”

“Use the whole carrot. Put the greens in salad, or cook them with some risotto—they are very good for you.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Carrots and cumin are great together.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“We juice carrots to use for stocks or other dishes, and then dehydrate the pulp. We confit carrots in oil, herbs, and spices to get that nice, fatty, succulent confit texture out of a carrot. We will fry some carrots into chips and pulse them into crumbs. We might pickle some carrots or ferment them, then dehydrate them and grind them into a powder to use as a seasoning. So we have now taken a carrot eight ways and give you those components back on one dish or throughout the four courses that you have during the course of a meal here. You have now gotten this whole depth of flavor from this carrot. If we do that with anywhere from two to eight components on a menu, all of a sudden you and your palate have been elevated to a whole different level. I equate it to an Old World wine compared to a New World wine: it is still red wine, but it is completely different.”

“The texture of cashews is so incredibly creamy, and works well in everything from appetizers to cashew cheese to entrees to desserts, which I’ll even top with a whipped cashew cream. Most live raw cheesecakes—which can range from German chocolate to key lime in flavor—are cashew-based, and they’re delicious.”

CAULIFLOWER


Season: autumn–winter



Flavor: sweet, with pungent notes of butter, mustard, nuts, and/or pepper, and a soft yet crunchy (when raw) / creamy (when cooked) texture



Volume: moderate



Nutritional profile: 64% carbs / 20% protein / 16% fat



Calories: 15 per ½-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: Better served cooked than raw. Bake, blanch, boil, braise, deep-fry, dry, fry, juice, mash, pressure-cook (2–3 minutes), puree, roast (20–25 minutes at 400°F), sauté, simmer, smoke, steam (5–10 minutes), stir-fry (2–5 minutes); however, overcooking highlights sulphur notes.



Tips: Do not overcook. Add pureed cauliflower to vegetable soups to give a creamy texture. Or slice thickly (¾ inch) into “steaks” and sauté to brown.

“I love chard! I love cooking the stems of rainbow chard, which have so much flavor. Just slice them and toss them in hot olive oil for one or two minutes, then add the greens, some garlic, some water or stock, and salt and pepper, and let them cook another two or three minutes. You can finish them with almonds, pine nuts, or pumpkin seeds for a little texture—and a shake of chili pepper flakes if you want a little kick.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)



“What we do here is build flavors: For example, we will stew chard with onions, garlic, and other traditional stewing ingredients that are really tasty, and then dehydrate some of it and turn it into a powder that will get worked into a gnocchi or pasta dough. It is a seasoning component that you would use about 5 percent in the dough. Next, you take the chard you didn’t dehydrate and put that in the dish with the gnocchi on top. We will also fry some chard as a garnish. All of the sudden, the chard takes on a whole level of flavor because we have incorporated it into different forms within the dish. So when people eat it, they say, ‘Wow—I have never tasted chard like this!’ This happens because we did not simply sauté some chard; we manipulated it, thought it through, and gave it back to you on a dish in a whole multitude of ways.”

Say (Vegan) Cheese!


Many vegans enjoy Daiya or Follow Your Heart brand vegan cheeses, which come in various flavors (e.g., cheddar, mozzarella) and often melt and stretch much as dairy cheese does.

I have been more impressed with the flavor of the artisanal vegan cheeses I’ve tasted, such as those at Pure Food and Wine in Manhattan. Portobello in Portland, Oregon, serves an artisanal vegan cheese plate that showcases cheeses from cheese-makers across the country, including Field Roast, Seattle-based producer of Chao Cheese (herb-crusted, tofu-based cheeses), Door 86 (Nashville), Heidi Ho (Portland, OR), Kite Hill (Hayward, CA), Punk Rawk Labs (Minneapolis), and Treeline Treenut Cheese (Kingston, NY).

“When cherries come in, I love to use them in savory dishes. I like to pair them with a creamy burrata, which is a nice textural contrast. I might use them in a gastrique to create a sweet and sour flavor to play off the creaminess of the cheese. Cherries are also great with grains like farro or freekeh with lots of lemon. I like cherries with sweeter herbs like chervil or parsley, and they are great with basil. Cherries pair well with nuts, but since they’re used with almonds so much, I will pair them with black walnuts.”

“I didn’t grow up with chiles [in Michigan], but they’ve grown on me over the years. Poblano chiles are my favorite. I love their great aroma and smoky flavor, and will fire roast them on an Asador grill [aka a chile pepper grill or dry roaster] on the stovetop. I’ll stuff them with quinoa and goat cheese, and serve with ancho and chipotle chiles, corn, cilantro, marjoram, and a little lime to perk it all up!”

“I spent two years in Hong Kong and found what they were doing with vegetarian food was very inspiring. At the time there was nowhere [in North America] to eat vegetarian food unless you wanted ‘hippy and crunchy.’ But in Hong Kong, it was natural because people ate vegetarian once or more a week and it was not considered weird. The flavors they were able to coax from meatless ingredients were amazing.”

“Corn is a religion where I grew up [in the New York Finger Lakes region]. We treat corn like the French treat their baguettes. You don’t eat the baguettes you bought in the morning for dinner! Likewise, you buy and serve corn as fresh as possible. Corn is all about timing because it loses fifty percent of its sweetness after harvest. Farmers pick corn three times a day: at seven in the morning, at noon, and at three. Seven a.m. is the best, but you have to eat it for lunch. You buy your three o’clock corn for dinner. I like it simple: corn, butter, and salt. My wife Isabel [Bogadtke] likes her corn with lime and cumin seeds.”

—CHRISTOPHER BATES, HOTEL FAUCHERE (MILFORD, PA)




“Corn is the one ingredient I work with best, and I get a non-GMO corn so it tastes great. I will focus in on it, and it will end up being the favorite of both our guests and our servers. I made a chilled corn soup that people loved: I cut the corn off the cob, made corn milk, made a stock out of corn cobs, sautéed the corn in a bunch of onion, thyme, and garlic, then added the corn milk and stock. I reduced it, pureed it all together, and added some half and half. I served the soup with shaved radishes and parsley. It’s great because it is a cold soup when it is hot out, with the peppery radishes cutting the richness of the soup and an accent of vegetal green parsley rounding out the flavor and bringing it all together.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)

CORNMEAL and POLENTA (see also GRITS)


Flavor: sweet, with notes of butter and/or corn, and a creamy texture (when cooked)



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: grain, made of dried corn kernels, ground to fine (e.g., corn flour, cornstarch), medium, or coarse (e.g., grits, polenta) texture



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 8% fat / 6% protein



Calories: 220 per ½-cup serving (whole grain, yellow, uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, broil, fry, grill, sauté, simmer



Timing: Cook until tender according to instructions on the back of the package, as this can vary from 1 minute (instant or fine) to 20–45 minutes (coarse).



Ratio: 1:3 (firm cornmeal, e.g., to grill or sauté) to 1:5–6 (soft, creamy cornmeal or polenta)



Tips: Opt for organic cornmeal. Use blue cornmeal, which is higher in protein than regular cornmeal, when you wish to add a light blueish, purplish hue to foods. Serve creamy polenta as an alternative to mashed potatoes. Alternatively, let polenta cool in a sheet pan; then cut into slices and broil, grill, or sauté lightly, before serving with tomato sauce and/or marinated vegetables.



Brand: Finely ground de la Estancia Organic Polenta is not an instant product but cooks to tender in less than 1 minute!

“I like making hot cucumber soup at home: I’ll cook the cucumbers with onion and a little extra-virgin olive oil and then add cumin, coriander, and masala curry. If I want the soup bright green, I’ll not add any white wine, but if I want a dull green, I’ll add white wine. To finish the soup, I might add either yogurt or crème fraîche—or if I want to take it even farther, I’ll add some kefir.”

“Cumin is one of my favorite spices, and a great supporting flavor. Its earthy/nutty/smoky flavor is very strong and can easily kill a dish—so you never want to use enough so that it can be tasted. Instead, just sprinkle a little on so that people will ask, ‘What is that flavor?!’ ”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)




“I love the smell of cumin, which reminds me of walking through the woods in Jamaica.… It’s very good with grains, as it brings out their earthy, woody flavor.”

—SHAWAIN WHYTE, CAFÉ BLOSSOM (NEW YORK CITY)

DEHYDRATING



“We use our dehydrator for a variety of things, including our powders, which we use a lot of. For example, we will dehydrate celery and then turn it into a powder for celery cake. We also dehydrate yellow tomatoes for tomato powder. We’ll also use the dehydrator for creating leathers with tomatoes, beets, and pears, or for turning cauliflower into crunchy little bits. Anything you can do in a dehydrator, you can do in an oven—it is simply faster using the dehydrator. The reason I use one is that if you are dehydrating something in the oven, you can’t use your oven for anything else.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)

“Our number-one dessert is crumbles. They’re seasonal, but often apple- or pear-based with berries. We’ll sweeten them with agave or brown sugar and season with some citrus zest and a splash of gin. Our topping is simple: brown sugar, a gluten-free flour blend (such as chickpea, rice, tapioca, and sorghum flours), and margarine or palm shortening.”

“We use five or six different varieties of eggplant—including Japanese eggplant, which have thinner skin and more meat to them. We have eggplant from May to November, which is seven months of eggplant. To keep it new, we choose different countries for inspiration. For example, I did a pop-up dinner and made Chinese sweet-and-sour eggplant, cooking it with chiles, Chinese vinegar, garlic, dark soy sauce, and cilantro. Sautéing the eggplant with all these ingredients makes it soak up all the flavors.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love vegetables in dessert because it is fun—that is number one! This is where we have our most creative dishes. The vegetable will be the catalyst, but I don’t want you leaving with a vegetable flavor—I want your last bite to be a sweet, happy moment at the end of the meal that brings together everything you just ate. Eggplant is more fruit than vegetable because it has seeds. It’s also like tofu in that it doesn’t have much flavor but will soak up the flavors you put it with. Eggplant has a luscious texture. I don’t know why I got obsessed with making eggplant tiramisu, but for some reason I did. We mix eggplant with mascarpone and then put it between layers of rosemary ladyfingers and it is just perfect!

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“You can’t not get the Eggplant Braciole when you come to Vedge. The dish is thin layers of eggplant that have been poached in olive oil and that are then wrapped around a filling of eggplant and roasted crushed cauliflower, finished with a green salsa verde. It has a lot of fresh herbs, a good punch of salt, and cured black olive on top. It has so many strong flavors, but you still taste eggplant and cauliflower. These dishes transcend the season, which we thought was important to do.”

—RICH LANDAU AND KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





“I’m working on a new roasted and stuffed eggplant dish right now, and the secret is avoiding the monotony of texture. I’m sure the dish will have some pine nuts for crunch, and most likely also some bulgur for chewiness, accented by feta cheese, onions, and lemon zest.”

Vegan Egg Substitutes


For breakfast, instead of scrambling eggs, “scramble” tofu (e.g., extra-firm) with herbs and/or vegetables. Firm tofu also replaces hard-boiled egg whites in vegan dishes (e.g., “egg salads”).


When baking, you can use Ener-G Egg Replacer, a potato starch–based product that can often replace eggs in the ratio of 1½ teaspoons Ener-G to 2 tablespoons water for each egg, or other commercial egg replacers. However, there are probably already egg replacers in your cupboard or refrigerator, as you’ll see below.


How to know which other substitute to use? First, determine whether its need is for binding (i.e., holding the mixture together, without the need to rise, e.g., casseroles, veggie burgers), leavening (i.e., by adding air bubbles to a batter or dough, as well-beaten eggs do, e.g., in baked goods such as breads, cakes, cupcakes, or muffins), or simply adding moisture.





Egg Substitutes, each equivalent to 1 egg (best use)


¼ cup applesauce (adding moisture, e.g., in brownies, cakes, cupcakes, quickbreads)

¼ cup avocado, mashed (binding)

1 teaspoon baking soda + 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (leavening and adding moisture)

½ mashed banana (adding moisture and/or binding, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)

¼ cup carbonated water (leavening)

1 tablespoon chia seed meal + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (adding moisture; for leavening, add ¼ teaspoon baking powder)

¼ cup full-fat coconut milk + 1 teaspoon baking powder (leavening, esp. in compatibly flavored dishes)

¼ cup dried fruit (e.g., apricot, prune) puree (adding moisture)

1 tablespoon ground flax seeds + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (binding; for leavening: add ¼ teaspoon baking powder, esp. in nut/seed-compatible dishes, e.g., whole-grain cookies, muffins, pancakes)

3 tablespoons nut butter, e.g., peanut (binding, e.g., grain-based veggie burgers)

¼ cup silken tofu, blended (adding moisture, esp. in heavier baked goods, e.g., brownies, carrot cakes)

¼ cup vegetable puree, e.g., beets, carrots, pumpkin (adding moisture)

¼ cup yogurt, dairy or nondairy (adding moisture, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)



“We don’t cook with eggs, so I use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with baking powder to make my cakes rise. I’ve used Ener-G Egg Replacer when baking cookies. It has also worked surprisingly well in ‘meringues’ and looks beautiful.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

FARRO (aka EMMER WHEAT)


[FAHR-oh]



Flavor: slightly sweet, with earthy notes of barley and/or nuts, and a chewy texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: whole grain; Note: farro is not the same as spelt, which is typically a very slow-cooking grain.



Gluten-free: no



Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 12% protein / 7% fat



Calories: 170 per ¼ cup (uncooked)



Protein: 7 grams



Timing: Presoak farro for fastest cooking. Although whole farro is available, most of the farro available in the U.S. is semipearled (semi-perlato or pearled (perlato), i.e., with some or all of the outside husk removed. Whole farro takes longest to cook (45–60 minutes or longer), while pearled farro can cook in as little as half that time. Simmer farro, covered, until tender.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup farro to 2–3 cups cooking liquid)



Tip: Add the cooking water from white cannellini beans to give a creamier, starchier texture to “farrotto.”

“Farro is my favorite grain because of its nuttiness. I like mixing it into green salads with dried apricots and radishes.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love farro’s nutty flavor and toothy texture, and the sensation of eating farrotto. Farro doesn’t give off starch the same way Arborio rice does, but it still has some of its own sauce like risotto.… You can make a different version each season: Spring calls for lots of peas, spring onions, spinach, and vegetable stock. Summer could be corn with tomatoes. Autumn farroto with butternut squash, kale, and roasted garlic could have Parmesan shaved on top. Winter farrotto could feature wild mushrooms and either vegetable stock or the soaking water from dried porcini.”

What it is: used as an herb (dried or fresh leaves), a spice (seeds), and as a vegetable (fresh)



Tips: Toast fenugreek seeds to bring out their flavor, which resembles maple syrup. (Indeed, fenugreek is used in making artificial maple syrup.) Long cooking (e.g., simmering) will quiet their flavor. Sprouted fenugreek seeds can be used in salads.

FLAXSEEDS


Flavor: slightly sweet, with notes of nuts, and a crunchy texture



Volume: quiet



What they are: seeds



Who says they’re healthful: Joel Fuhrman, in his “Top Super Foods for Super Immunity”



What’s healthful about them: 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds every day—such as on cereal or in a smoothie—fulfills daily omega-3 fatty acids needs.



Tips: Buy whole seeds and grind immediately before using. Seeds must be ground to release their full nutritional value. Do not cook on high heat if you want to maintain nutritional benefits. To use as an egg substitute when baking, use 1 heaping tablespoon to substitute for 1 large egg: soak flaxseeds in hot water in a 1:3 ratio before blending into a thick paste (1 tablespoon flaxseeds to 3 tablespoons water).

FLOUR, RICE



“I like to use rice flour—grinding in some Arborio rice for texture, and some sesame or coriander seeds for texture and flavor—as a crust for fried mushrooms. Just dip the mushrooms into soy milk, or rice milk with a little Dijon mustard added for viscosity, and then into the rice flour mixture before frying.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)





FLOUR, SPELT



“Because spelt flour doesn’t have as much gluten as wheat flour, muffins made with it don’t rise as high, so instead of filling muffin tins two-thirds full, we fill them three-quarters full.”

—MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX, AZ)




“We make apple cider doughnuts with spelt flour, which is very good for you, with lots of vitamins and easy to digest. We tried making the doughnut with whole-grain wheat flour, but it was very heavy. To sweeten the doughnut as well as other cakes, I use maple syrup, which is not overpowering. In 2010, Time Out awarded us ‘best doughnut,’ and the funny thing is my partner owns a Dunkin’ Donuts.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“I think spelt flour pizza has more flavor than white flour pizza. It’s really good served with pears and ricotta.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)





FLOUR, SPROUTED


Brands: Essential Eating, To Your Health





Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company


As a chef, my interest is in whole-plant cooking—from root to fruit—as integral to a more healthful and enjoyable way of living. But food has to first satisfy taste, so the challenge is always to find the right combination of ingredients and balance of flavors and textures. I have been experimenting with grains and beans in nontraditional ways: folded into muffins, added to savory custards, and pulverized into tart crusts. This also allows me to bring energy-rich plant foods into our products replacing white flours and sugars, which are devoid of nutrition. Sprouted-grain flours are especially interesting to me because they offer not only great flavor, but also an energy-rich ingredient for baked goods.

Because my kitchen is focused on developing savory baked items, I try to create the flavors first and then select how they are best presented.

Here are some combos:





Savory:


sprouted spelt flour muffin with asparagus, sorrel, pumpkin seed, and parmesan

sprouted corn flour muffin with pickled beet, macadamia nut, and goat cheese

millet flour biscuit with roasted chickpeas, sumac, and sesame seed

savory rice pudding with confit of fennel, carrot, and tarragon

quinoa pudding with broccoli and cheddar





Fruit:


coconut flour scone with wild blueberries, ginger root, and hempseed

wild rice and quinoa muffin with bananas, dried cranberries, and walnuts

chocolate cherry scone with vanilla bean kefir and almonds

strawberry jam muffin with pomegranate molasses, Meyer lemon, and chia seed





FLOWERS, EDIBLE


While several varieties of flowers are edible—such as (sweet licorice) anise hyssop, (cucumber-like, sweet honey-like) borage, carnations, chicory, (garlicy, oniony) chives, chrysanthemums, daisies, day lilies, (herbal, pungent, sweet) lavender, (bitter, floral, sour) marigolds, (honey, peppery) nasturtiums, (minty) pansies, and (sweet) violets—most do not add much flavor of their own. Rather, they’re mostly decorative.





“We grow edible flowers on our roof at Mélisse.… Pollen is what gives most edible flowers their sweet, individual flavors.… Nasturtiums are stronger flavored than most edible flowers—they have a very strong, floral, peppery, spicy flavor. Yellow wood sorrel is also strongly sour.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)





FREEKEH (aka FRIKEH)


[FREE-kah]



Flavor: earthy notes of grass, meat, nuts, and/or smoke, with a chewy texture



Volume: moderate



What it is: young green wheat that has been set on fire before harvesting; i.e., grain



Techniques: simmer (20–30 minutes)



Ratio: 1: 1½–2 (1 cup freekeh to 1½–2 cups cooking liquid)



Tip: To bring out its nuttiness, toast in a pan before cooking.



Possible substitute: bulgur + drops of liquid smoke

“When I was twenty-six, I went to France for the first time. My takeaway was that the French love vegetables! It was simple food with a tremendous impact. I also learned that they love to use pressure cookers to cook their vegetables. It makes the vegetables turn into a soft state, sort of a melting texture. The aromas from this technique are like nothing else.… During my time in France, it felt like every meal had a tart! Or if Americans are thought to always be eating hot dogs and hamburgers, I felt the same could be said about the French and their tarts. In France, lunch is the big meal of the day, so dinner is often lighter—such as a zucchini tart with custard and curry spices, served with a salad. I learned from a French woman to make my tart dough with half-butter, half-margarine, which made a crisper tart shell, but now I use 100 percent Earth Balance for our vegan tart.”

“Ginger might not have been a part of traditional Shojin [Buddhist monk] cuisine, but I can’t imagine not using it—I can’t be restrained by the old rules, which also prohibited tea and alcohol. Ginger is a magical ingredient with extraordinary flavor and textures that goes well with almost everything, and it has healing properties that can quickly and inexpensively heal my wife’s winter colds.… One of my secrets when making pickled ginger is instead of cooling the ginger in the boiling pickling liquid in the fridge, I’ll drain it and cool it with a fan, which concentrates its flavor.”

GRAINS, FAST-COOKING (see COUSCOUS and QUINOA)





[WHOLE] GRAINS AND CEREALS (see also COUSCOUS, WHOLE-WHEAT; POLENTA; QUINOA; RICE, BROWN; WHEAT BERRIES, etc.)


Tips: It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of grains you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, there are some general rules of thumb that may be helpful: Rinse grains before cooking. Combine grain with the cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid in the ratio indicated for the specific grain. Bring to a boil, add the grain, and bring to a boil again. Then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for the cooking time indicated. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved; then remove from heat and leave covered for 5–15 minutes before fluffing with a fork and serving.

“You can’t overcook grains like barley or farro. Cooking farro risotto style as farrotto is common in Italy, and I’ll cook barley the same way, so that it’s chewy and toothy. But bulgur can overcook and turn mushy, so you really have to keep an eye on it. Grains are also great to dehydrate and powder for crusts… or to dry [dehydrate] and fry, to turn into ‘Rice Krispies.’ ”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“The secret is not to serve too large a portion of grains on a plate or people will get bored with them. I like to season grains with dried fruits, such as apricots, currants, figs, or apples and pears in the winter. Or I’ll season them with powders and ashes [made from dehydrated vegetables]. Or I’ll fill things like cabbage, chard, or kale with grains, and roll them up dolma-style—such as quinoa and dehydrated kimchi powder wrapped up in a cabbage leaf with dried figs or currants and pickled peppers or cucumbers. The overall impact it makes takes your brain on a ride.”

—AARON WOO, NATURAL SELECTION (PORTLAND, OR)

“There are two ends of the cooking spectrum you want to concentrate on—one is high heat and the other is low heat. On high heat you want to cook your vegetable higher and faster than you normally would to get that sear and caramelization and let it stay crunchy on the inside so you have a textural contrast. Or go low and slow; that way you get a crispy outside and a dehydrated chew on the inside. Home cooks know how to do this with meat; they just need to do it with vegetables. A good example of a high-heat, fast-cooking dish we do now is the Chinese green choy sum. It gets a nice crispiness, it is barely cooked, and it gets tossed in a bowl and wilts on itself. If we cook the choy sum really low, it turns into a flat, dehydrated, crispy green.”

GREENS, LEAFY (see GREENS, BITTER; and GREENS, SALAD)


What they are: bitter greens and salad greens



Who says they’re healthful: The Center for Science in the Public Interest’s Nutrition Action includes leafy greens on its “10 Best Foods” list, mentioning “powerhouse greens” like collard greens, kale, mustard greens, spinach, Swiss chard, and turnip greens.

“I grill almost every vegetable—radishes, kohlrabi, cabbage. Even spinach, kale, and chard—I’ll put some olive oil and salt on them, pile them up, and grill them on high heat, flipping them twice. Grilled beets are great, although I’ll parcook them for about five minutes first, so they’re a little soft—and you can cook parsnips and radishes the same way.”

HERBS, DRIED


Volume: typically louder than their fresh versions, so adjust accordingly



Tip: Use dried herbs early in the cooking process, as they need time to reconstitute and release their flavor.





HIZIKI (aka HIJIKI)


[hee-ZEE-kee; hee-JEE-kee]



Flavor: salty, with notes of the earth and/or sea, and a delicate yet firm texture

What it is: sea vegetable, with the appearance of dried black threads



Calories: 5 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: sauté, simmer (about 30–40 minutes)



Tips: Its grittiness requires it to be soaked (twice) in cold water for 10 minutes each time before use (discarding the gritty soaking water). Soaking will also tame its saltiness. Also, hiziki will expand fourfold, taking on the appearance of black angel hair pasta.

JACKFRUIT, UNRIPE GREEN


Season: summer



Flavor: neutral, with faint notes of apple, banana, lychee, mango, melon (e.g., cantaloupe), and/or pineapple; and the chewy, flaky, juicy, or meaty texture of dry pineapple, shredded chicken, or pulled pork



Volume: quiet



What it is: tropical fruit



Nutritional profile: 92% carbs / 5% protein / 3% fat



Calories: 155 per 1-cup serving (sliced, raw)



Protein: 2 grams



Technique: marinate



Tips: Look in Asian or Indian markets for unripe (aka green or young) jackfruit in cans (packed in brine, not sweet syrup!) or frozen (packed in brine). Chef Susan Feniger prefers using shredded and cooked jackfruit to processed faux meats in Street’s vegan dishes such as baos and tacos. She has found that jackfruit takes on whatever flavors it’s cooked with and even fools meat eaters. You’ll typically want to rinse, drain, and shred before using; alternatively, cut into bite-sized triangles, as you would pineapple. Jackfruit is the world’s largest tree fruit and can grow up to three feet long. Keep an eye out for products from Annie Ryu’s Global Village Fruits.

JUICES (see also SMOOTHIES)


Technique Tips: We love our Champion juicer (as do many of the other experts interviewed for this book) and know others who are happy with their Omega juicers. Diane Forley of Flourish makes juice in her Vitamix, adding a little water and then straining the juice through a nut milk bag—and finds the cleanup even easier than with a juicer.

Flavor Tips: Avoid mixing kale with romaine, which ends up “tasting like mud,” according to NYC’s Blossom owner Pamela Elizabeth. To add a sweet note, mix green juices with agave nectar, beets, coconut water, dates, fruit, honey, or maple syrup.





“My favorite green juice is made from apples, celery, collard greens, kale, and lemon.”

—DIANE FORLEY, FLOURISH (SCARSDALE, NEW YORK)




“My default morning juice is one made from cilantro, fennel, ginger, kale, lemon, pears, and pineapple.”

—MATTHEW KENNEY, M.A.K.E. (SANTA MONICA)




“A dash of lemon juice is the best way to cut the ‘fresh-mown grass’ flavor of some of the stronger green juices. Even better is adding lemon juice, apple juice, and ginger.”

—MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)

KALE


Season: autumn–spring



Flavor: bitter/sweet (esp. in winter), with pungent notes of cabbage, and a rather tough texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: leafy, green vegetable



Nutritional profile: 72% carbs / 16% protein / 12% fat



Calories: 35 per 1-cup serving (raw, chopped)



Protein: 2 grams



Techniques: blanch, boil (4–5 minutes), braise, grill, long cooking, marinate, parboil, puree, raw, sauté (about 8 minutes over medium heat), steam (4–5 minutes), stew, stir-fry



Tips: Opt for organic kale. Many kale aficionados prefer the variety known as black kale (aka dinosaur kale or Tuscan kale), for its greater flavor complexity and silky texture. Macerate (and marinate) raw kale in Dijon mustard to flavor it and soften its texture.

“Kale isn’t a summer crop, but there’s so much demand for it that it’s served year-round. In the summer, the hot sun can make it more bitter and tougher, so it’s less of a salad green and more of a braising green, requiring longer cooking to soften it.”

—PAM BROWN, GARDEN CAFÉ (WOODSTOCK, NY)




“If I’m making a kale salad, I’ll massage the kale with oil and maybe Dijon mustard. I want a combination of acid, oil, and salt.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“I love serving charred kale with smoked tofu, which I’ll mince like bacon bits and let provide the same kind of smoky accent.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I love kale—and was an early adapter. I’ve only eaten it raw over the past couple of years. Before that, I preferred it braised, or sautéed with garlic and olive oil, or added to pasta along with feta cheese and pine nuts.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR OF THE MOOSEWOOD COOKBOOK AND THE HEART OF THE PLATE




“We go through crates and crates of kale every week, and always prefer the less bitter, more refined blue-green Tuscan kale over regular kale, which is much tougher. With either kale, we’ll marinate it in garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to soften it.”

—CASSIE AND MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)

“I love kasha in salads, where its earthy flavor is balanced nicely by the sweetness of corn. Not only is it great in stuffed cabbage and pilafs, but I like it as croquettes: I’ll make them from kasha and mashed potatoes, browning them in a skillet, and serving them with a sauce or just some caramelized onions.”

LEGUMES (see also specific BEANS, CHICKPEAS, LENTILS, PEANUTS, PEAS, and SOYBEANS)


Tip: Many chefs are experimenting with smoking legumes to enhance their “meatiness.”





Cooking Legumes


There are three major categories of legumes:

pulses, including chickpeas, lentils, dried beans, dried peas

fresh beans and fresh peas

peanuts and soybeans



It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of legumes you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, here are some helpful rules of thumb:

Rinse legumes to remove any dirt or foreign objects (e.g., tiny pebbles).

Soak most legumes overnight in water before cooking. This shortens their cooking time and increases their digestibility. Discard the soaking water. (If time is of the essence, legumes can still benefit from a quick soak achieved by bringing them to a boil in water, then removing from heat, and letting them stand for at least an hour. Drain and rinse before proceeding.)

Combine legumes with cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, partially covering the pot, and simmer. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved, and then remove from heat.





LEMONGRASS


Flavor: sour/sweet, with notes of citrus (e.g., lemon or lemon zest) and/or flowers



Volume: quiet–moderate/loud



What it is: Southeast Asian grass used as a flavoring



Techniques: puree, simmer



Tips: Use fresh. Remove whole stalks after cooking and before serving. Otherwise, puree or slice these fibrous stalks very, very thinly.



Possible substitute: lemon zest

LENTILS—IN GENERAL (see also specific LENTILS)


Season: autumn–winter



Flavor: sweet, with astringent/earthy notes, and textures ranging from firm to mushy when cooked



Volume: moderate



What they are: legumes



Nutritional profile: 70% carbs / 27% protein / 3% fats



Calories: 230 per 1-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 18 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer (always cook thoroughly)



Timing: Cook until tender, typically less than 30 minutes.

“I love cooking lentils until they’re soft, then combining them with vegetables—especially onions and mushrooms, but also things like broccoli—and pressing the mixture into a loaf pan and baking it for 40 minutes. After it’s cool, I’ll slice it and serve it with mashed potatoes and gravy.”

“I learned how to make black lentils when I cooked for two years at Bucara in Delhi, which is one of the best Indian restaurants in the world. After soaking them overnight and draining them, we would slow-boil them over low heat for two hours before seasoning them with ginger, garlic paste, tomato puree, salt, chili powder, unsalted butter, and heavy cream. They were so rich and delicious that we’d make 50 or 60 pounds of them every day to serve 300 guests! I still make them the same way today.”

“Red lentils are my favorite lentils. I love their flavor, which is both lentil-y and unique at the same time. And I love how they break down to reach such a creamy texture.

MEDITERRANEAN CUISINES (see GREEK CUISINE, ITALIAN CUISINE—SOUTHERN, etc.)



“So much Mediterranean food is inherently vegan, which is why we refer to Crossroads as a Mediterranean restaurant. We don’t use the word ‘vegan’ here. This way, the food is not seen as foreign to people who eat here. At Crossroads, people are not eating tofu or tempeh or seitan, whose textures are foreign to most people. While I like tempeh, you are not going to convince someone to go vegan if that is the first thing they try. People need familiar food that is transitional, and that will depend on the person. Our spanakopita or spiced chickpeas are dishes people are already acquainted with, and our risotto is the least threatening dish on the menu and something that people have already had.”

Make Your Own Almond Milk


Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company says it’s easy to make your own delicious almond milk by

soaking raw almonds overnight

draining them

combining soaked almonds with fresh water in a 1:3 ratio in a Vitamix

straining the milk through a fine-mesh nut milk bag

adding cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)



You can also cook down almond milk, adding a pinch of pectin, then chill, to create a yogurt-like almond cream to enjoy on its own or with berries, granola, etc.

“We make our own coconut milk–based ice creams and use Irish moss to stabilize them. We’ll even top them with ‘whipped cream’ from a siphon, which is also coconut milk-based. Coconut Bliss is a fantastic Oregon-based dairy-free ‘ice cream’ made with coconut milk and agave, which was recently sold to a dairy.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)




“We have a new vegan truck for selling burgers, and desserts like our Vegan Fat Boys, which are vegan brownies filled with coconut milk–based Coconut Bliss ice cream. The texture is very rich and creamy, not icy, and its flavor is not overpowering.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“We make our ice cream from a blend of coconut milk and soy milk, which prevents the flavor, texture, and color of either milk from interfering with that of the ice cream. The result is a very thick and creamy ice cream.… Our roast pumpkin ice cream is accented mostly by cinnamon, but also allspice, cloves, and nutmeg.… Coconut milk has such a high fat content that all you need to do is add a bit of powdered sugar and run it through a charged canister to have nice, thick whipped cream.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)




“Our signature ice cream starts with coconut cream, organic unrefined cane sugar, agave, and a trace amount of plant-based stabilizers (guar and xanthan gum), and works well with exotic spicy and savory flavors, such as toasted pine nut and fennel, or Mexican chocolate with cayenne and cinnamon, or Thai chili peanut. Our nut-based flavors are made with an almond and cashew blend, and work best with more traditional flavors like caramel, chocolate, cookie, peanut butter, and vanilla. Our soft ice cream flavors are made with a soy base.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)




“Coconut milk is fantastic—it’s saved our lives in being able to serve our vegan guests. We use it a lot in vegan desserts, like our coconut milk panna cotta. The mouthfeel is not the same as when making a dairy panna cotta, so you’ve got to use a bit more vanilla and sugar. And we’ve made mousses by putting a mixture of coconut milk and agar-agar through an iSi whipped cream dispenser.”

—MARK LEVY, THE POINT (SARANAC LAKE, NY)





MILK, GOAT


Flavor: salty/sour/ sweet



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Can be easier to digest given its lower level of lactose (4.1%) than cow’s milk (4.7%) and the absence of cow’s milk’s main problem-causing protein (alpha SI casein). Sweeten and reduce over medium heat to make cajeta (a thick Mexican caramel sauce).

“We tested lots of different nondairy milks to come up with our recipe for a latte with the creamy richness of cow’s milk, which is half hemp milk and half coconut milk, plus agave nectar as a sweetener, added to two shots of espresso. Either will be good on its own, but the fat from the coconut milk adds great richness, while the hemp milk adds a more understated nutty flavor, and together they foam up really well.”

What it is: whole grain



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 82% carbs / 11% protein / 7% fat



Calories: 210 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 6 grams



Techniques: dry roast, marinate, pressure-cook, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Simmer about 15–20 minutes (chewier) to 30–40 minutes (softer), until desired tenderness is reached.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup millet to 2–3 cups liquid. Use more liquid for softer texture; also, given its flavor neutrality, use vegetable stock instead of water.)



Tips: Toast before steaming to bring out its flavor. Marinate, or cook risotto-style: Sauté millet before adding liquid to simmer slowly.



Possible substitute: couscous

“When I opened Verbena [in 1994], I would go to Kalustyan’s [the famed Manhattan spice and specialty food store] and buy unusual grains to serve.

“If green vegetables are the king of Super Immunity, mushrooms are the queen.… White, cremini, portobello, oyster, maitake, and reishi mushrooms have all been shown to have anticancer effects.”

—DR. JOEL FUHRMAN, IN SUPER IMMUNITY




“Bottom line, mushrooms are good medicine. Cook them well before eating them and enjoy a variety rather than any one specific type.”

—DR. ANDREW WEIL, ON DRWEIL.COM




“Raw mushrooms are technically not supposed to be good for you. Also, the texture you get from them when they are cooked is much more exciting than when they are raw. So how do you give your mushrooms flavor without heat [as in raw cuisine]? You do it with citrus and salt because they will bring out a lot of flavor and enhance its texture. If you rub a mushroom with salt, the water comes out and the solids collapse and it becomes soft.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Abalone mushrooms, which are available in August and again in February through April in the Pacific Northwest, are incredibly meaty, meaty mushrooms. They’re giant, about five inches in diameter. I’ll slice them thick, score them, and poach them for an hour in butter, cognac, shallot, garlic, parsley, and thyme until they’re soft, and serve them with candied pistachios.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“I love trumpet mushrooms, which are milder in flavor and have the texture of scallops. They take marinades really well.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I’ll slice large Trumpet Royale mushrooms into scallops, whose great texture they resemble, although they’re not as yielding or buttery. They can be woody, so I’ll acidulate them with lemon juice, which makes them tender and lovely, and their residual sugar helps with their caramelization when I sauté them in garlic and olive oil.”

“We’ve been making our Hen of the Woods mushroom pâté for years now, and it tastes like wild, foraged maitakes.

We use agar-agar to make a port gelée.”

“There is nothing on the planet like matsutake mushrooms! You’ve got to treat them delicately. I’ve served them with housemade buckwheat noodles, or simply grilled over rice.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)




“There may be no more prized ingredient in Japanese cuisine than matsutake mushrooms. They are as celebrated in Japan as truffles are in Italy or France. I love the texture of the mushroom, and will never forget a shockingly good version of a sukiyaki dish I tasted that featured them. But that dish was like a short-distance dash—and I like serving them cooked in a pot as a dobin mushi, which really celebrates their lasting flavor and is more like a long-distance marathon.”

“The inspiration for my artichoke oysters dish [which is served with artichoke puree, crispy oyster mushrooms, yellow tomato béarnaise, and kelp caviar] came from peeling an artichoke one day. I was peeling the leaves and one fell on a plate on its back and it looked like an oyster shell. One of the things I love to do is re-create dishes I love that I miss being a vegan and dishes that are unexpected in a vegan diet. The inspiration was nature, and it turned into ‘oysters Rockefeller.’ ”

Chef Colin Bedford of North Carolina’s Fearrington House on Mushrooms


At the Fearrington House, we treat mushrooms very much like meat. We will take larger king oyster or maitake mushrooms and confit them whole in olive oil, or we will sous-vide them as that is another great technique to infuse flavor and to create layers of flavors. The flavors differ throughout the year. In March, we use thyme, garlic, and white wine, as the wine really brightens the flavor.

King Oysters are nice, big, fat mushrooms. We will confit them with garlic, bay leaf, and thyme. The ratio of stalk to cap is crazy—like 5 percent cap to 95 percent stalk, so we use the stalk for carpaccio, cooking the mushrooms at 85°C for one to one-and-a-half hours with lots of aromatics. Once they are cool, we slice them thin on a mandoline and lay them on the plate. With the dish, we add crosnes, which are like a really cool artichoke; sunchokes, roasted cippolini onions, and garlic chips for a crispy texture.

Maitake mushrooms are my favorite. They have a meaty quality and are so versatile. We will confit them whole. Sunchokes work really well with them, as does ginger, which gives it a warm, earthy tone—with fresh ginger adding heat, and candied ginger mellowing the flavor. I’ll also use sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup—we use Mikuni Wild Harvest’s NOBLE maple syrup.

Chanterelles are another favorite. Thyme is one of my favorite pairings, as is sage; I will use one or the other. In the fall or winter, black garlic also works well with them: We will caramelize and puree the garlic, which has a kind of fermented quality that brings up sweetness, and from there we will add some Madeira and maple [syrup] for more flavor. Chanterelles are a mushroom that we don’t cook to order. We like to cook them beforehand and stew them down with aromatics, butter, and just a pinch of white wine at the end to balance the flavors.

Matsutakes call for keeping it simple, so we don’t mess around with them too much, and simply confit them. After they are cooked, we will score and then pan sear them so you get that contrasting texture.

Doubloons are smaller than shiitake mushrooms, but we treat them the same way.





Pickling Mushrooms with Colin Bedford


Beech mushrooms are perfect for pickling, as they are essentially sponges. A cremini would be too hard; you would just get little nuggets. When pickling mushrooms, the pickling solution will depend on the season, which will influence our choice of vinegar—for example:

• Autumn: madeira and sherry vinegars

• Winter: port wine, red wine, and raspberry vinegars

• Spring: lemon and chardonnay vinegars

• Summer: white balsamic and champagne vinegars





MUSTARD, e.g., DIJON (see also GREENS, MUSTARD; MUSTARD POWDER; MUSTARD SEEDS)


Flavor: bitter; hot, with peppery, spicy notes



Volume: moderate–very loud



Tips: For most purposes, choose Dijon mustard (made with verjus instead of vinegar); other options include stone-ground and/or whole-grain mustard. Add mustard at the end of the cooking process.

NOODLES, KELP


Flavor: neutral, with a toothy (green) or crunchy (clear) texture



Volume: quiet (clear)–moderate (green)



What they are: noodles made from sea vegetables



What’s healthful about them: virtually free of calories, carbohydrates, fat



Gluten-free: yes



Tips: There are two primary types of kelp noodles: clear (bland in flavor, crunchy in texture) and green (with seaweed notes and the toothiness of al dente pasta). Because they are not heated above 110°F during the production process, they are said to be appropriate for raw food diets.

“During a kaiseki menu, you want to make a certain impact with the very first course, and to make sure the main course itself is outstanding. But the courses before and after the main course should be toned down, to enhance its impact. I would serve something very simple and delicious before the main course, like soba noodles.”

Tips: Lightly toast the dried seaweed sheet before using, by waving it over an open flame on your stovetop, which enhances its flavor and texture. At traditional sushi restaurants, vegetarian options typically include white or brown short-grain sticky rice rolls filled with avocado and/or cucumber. However, New York City’s Beyond Sushi features iron-rich six-grain rice—a delicious medley of rye berries, barley, pearl barley, brown rice, red rice, and black rice.

It even works with sautéed spinach and greens as balance to the bitterness.”

Volume: quiet



What it is: whole grain



Nutritional profile: 70% carbs / 15% protein / 15% fats



Calories: 110 per 1-ounce serving (uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer



Timing: Cook Scottish oats about 10 minutes, or old-fashioned (aka rolled) oats about 10–15 minutes, covered; steel-cut oats will cook in about 30 minutes, although cooking time can be cut by presoaking.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup oats to 2–3 cups liquid, e.g., almond milk or water)



Tips: To make a creamier oatmeal, use Scottish oats and/or substitute milk (e.g., almond) for some or all of the water. For chewier oatmeal, opt for steel-cut oats. In-between? You might prefer good old-fashioned rolled oats. Whole oat groats can be used in savory dishes, such as pilafs.

OIL—IN GENERAL


Virtually all oils have about 120 calories per 1-tablespoon serving, and are high in fats and low in nutrients.



Tips: Select an oil based on its intended purpose, e.g., finishing dishes (e.g., extra-virgin olive, flavored), or low-, medium-, or high-temperature (e.g., grapeseed, peanut, safflower) cooking. Always opt for unrefined and less processed oils (e.g., “expeller-pressed” or “cold pressed”), which are free of chemicals and solvents, and choose organic corn and soybean oils.

“Camelina seed oil has a really interesting, strong, seed-y flavor. I’ll combine it with caramelized lemon and green garlic.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, CANOLA


Flavor: neutral



Volume: quiet



What it is: rapeseed oil from CANada (which is where it gets its name)



Techniques: bake, fry, sauté



Tips: Use only organic, expeller-pressed canola oil, as many canola oils are made from GMO seeds; otherwise, opt for another oil altogether. Use as fresh as possible, and check regularly for rancidity (as it goes rancid quickly). Canola oil can be used for medium- (e.g., baking) to high-temperature (e.g., frying) cooking. Use with boldly flavored dishes that would obscure the flavor of more expensive oils.

“I’ll blend coconut oil with cacao powder to make raw truffles, while I use coconut butter in raw desserts.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“The choice of oil in baking is important. For cookies I will use canola, grapeseed, or coconut oil. The coconut oil is used in our doughnuts and cakes as well, but you have to be careful so that the flavor does not become overpowering.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Coconut oil is a liquid when it’s at 72°F and up, and a solid with the texture of butter or shortening at temperatures below 72°F. When we make biscuits, we’ll use solid coconut oil and cut it into the dough, which results in a layering effect and flakier biscuits. We’ll also cut solid coconut oil into our pancake batter, where it has a leavening effect that makes our pancakes light and fluffy—more so than with canola oil.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)





OIL, FLAXSEED


What’s healthful about it: omega-3 fatty acids



Tips: Flaxseeds are said to be even higher in lignans than flaxseed oil is. Heating flaxseed oil destroys its nutrients. Store in the refrigerator.

“The flavor of olive oil can sometimes be overpowering, so I will often use grapeseed oil—which has a nice, neutral flavor—in a ratio of two parts grapeseed oil to one part olive oil.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, HAZELNUT


Flavor: notes of hazelnuts



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Use for low- to medium-temperature cooking (e.g., baking, sautéing), or as a finishing oil. Use caution when cooking, as hazelnut oil burns easily. Store in the refrigerator, and use within a few months after opening.

OIL, NUT (see OIL, ALMOND; OIL, HAZELNUT; OIL, PISTACHIO; OIL, WALNUT)





OIL, OLIVE


Flavor: earthy notes of fruit and/or olives, with a rich texture



Volume: quieter (e.g., lighter-colored virgin)–louder (e.g., deeper-colored extra-virgin)



Techniques: bake, fry, raw, sauté (on low heat)



Tips: Use raw, or warm only to low temperatures. Opt for lighter, quieter virgin (aka “pure”) oil for baking, frying, grilling, roasting, and sautéing, and darker, louder extra-virgin oil for dressing salads or drizzling on bruschetta or pizza. For salad dressings, the typical ratio is one part vinegar to three or four parts extra-virgin olive oil, but those looking to lower the fat in their diets (not to mention calories) should consider using less oil.

“I can sum up in two words the difference between vegetarian cooking in the 1970s vs. today: olive oil. Back then, it was common to mask dishes with the richness of butter and cream. Olive oil lets more of the flavor shine through, particularly dishes made with garlic and herbs.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR




“One you’ve fallen in love with the flavor of extra-virgin olive oil, there’s no place to go after that. I’ll only use it to finish dishes. For high-heat cooking, I use canola, grapeseed, or safflower oil—or some combination thereof.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

You can use applesauce or other fruit purees (e.g., banana, prune, pumpkin), and even pureed black beans in dark-colored baked goods such as brownies and chocolate cakes. Substitute vegetable stock for oil when sautéing garlic, onions, or other vegetables.

ORGANIC PRODUCE


Tip: Opt for organic produce whenever possible—and definitely when you buy one of the Environmental Working Group (EWG)’s so-called “Dirty Dozen Plus” fruits or vegetables, which are those most affected by chemical contamination, i.e., apples, bell peppers, celery, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers, collard greens, cucumbers, grapes, kale, nectarines (imported), peaches, potatoes, spinach, strawberries, and summer squash.



The EWG notes that “[t]he health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure. Use EWG’s Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides™ to reduce your exposures as much as possible, but eating conventionally-grown produce is far better than not eating fruits and vegetables at all.”

“I love parsley as a flavor. Parsley risotto is amazing, and its color is as vibrant as its flavor. There is more to parsley than just the leaf; I use the stems and roots as well. The stems add good texture, and I use them to add crunch to soups. As for the root, which has an herbaceousness similar to parsnips, I like to roast and puree them for soups as well.… People also need to remember that there is more than flat-leaf parsley out there. I am a fan of curly parsley, which is often overlooked and has an intense, almost celery-like flavor. There was a time in America when you couldn’t serve a plate without the orange wedge and curly parsley.”

“I’ve made parsnip jam by seasoning it with vanilla and rice wine vinegar.”

—MARK LEVY, THE POINT (SARANAC LAKE, NY)




“If I’m serving a smooth pureed parsnip soup, I’ll layer other parsnip flavors into the dish—for example, both cooked and raw parsnips, fried parsnip chips, and a confited parsnip ‘butter.’ I’ll keep working to think of new ways to get more parsnip flavor into the dish one more time—like taking the parsnip oil from confited parsnips and reemulsifying it back into the soup. All together, the flavor becomes so much more impactful.”

What it is: whole-grain product (refined)



Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 15% protein / 4% fats



Calories: 175 per 1-cup serving (whole-wheat spaghetti, cooked)



Protein: 7 grams



Tips: There are more whole-grain varieties than ever, including brown rice, buckwheat, corn, oat, quinoa, rice, spelt, whole-wheat, etc. Experiment with various shapes, e.g., penne, rotini, shells, etc.



Possible substitutes: spiralized vegetables (e.g., zucchini) instead of linguini, spaghetti, etc.; sliced vegetables (e.g., eggplant, summer squash, sweet potato) instead of lasagna noodles





“There are entire regions of Italy that make pasta without eggs. Gnocchi is made without eggs in Liguria [so it’s naturally vegan]. I don’t use eggs in my ravioli dough—I use tapioca flour. I sometimes stuff ravioli with thick cashew cream, or kale, or a vegetable puree. I’ve served English pea ravioli with morels, mint, lemon zest, and sweated shallots.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)




“Pastas are a good way to get people to try a vegan dish in a vegan restaurant. Pizzas, too. They’re a friendly entry point that can help to pull people in, and when they’re served with ingredients like heirloom tomatoes or pestos, they’re not intimidating.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)

Talking with Chef Chris Eddy of Winvian about Cooking for Vegetarians


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was a simple vegetarian pappardelle dish I was served at Winvian, a unique Connecticut resort that houses eighteen individually designed cottages, including a helicopter and a treehouse. It featured a green sauce, along with sautéed cauliflower, mushrooms, and onions, and a very light dusting of grated cheese on top. The creamy sauce turned out to be a steamed broccoli puree made in a Vitamix with a bit of ice (“to cool the broccoli as quickly as possible,” according to chef Chris Eddy), some clear vegetable stock (“so as not to interfere with the beautiful green color”), a hint of heat in the form of either cayenne or chili pepper flakes (“always—it’s a ‘calling card’ that leaves an impression even after you’ve finished eating”), and just a touch of brown butter (“to add an amazing dimension to the sauce”). It’s based on a “ridiculously simple” technique Eddy learned while working with Chef Alain Ducasse and, I can attest, it’s ridiculously delicious.

Eddy says the technique works just as well with other vegetables—whether cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, or parsnips—and if added richness is desired, one could substitute cream for some of the clear vegetable stock (“although its whiteness fades the bright colors”), though the dish is creamy and rich even without added cream.

While Eddy characterizes Winvian’s customers as about 35 to 40 percent pescetarian, he and chef de cuisine Patrick Espinoza and their kitchen team spent a month eating vegetarian during the summer of 2013, just for the experience of putting themselves into the shoes of the significant portion of Winvian’s clientele (“about 7 or 8 percent of our customers”) who eat vegetarian. Why? “Number one, we love vegetables,” Eddy admits. But out of compassion for Winvian’s vegetarian customers, “We wanted to ‘feel their pain.’ We came to understand their frustration [at other restaurants] of only being offered the same dishes again and again—whether eggplant Parmesan, or risotto, or a salad—when they went out to dine.” In addition to prompting Eddy and his team to come up with an ever-changing array of dishes like the incredible pappardelle I fell in love with, their month-long vegetarian experiment had an added bonus: a number of Eddy’s cooks discovered that they felt healthier and sometimes less irritable.

“Now, we like to go all out for our vegetarian guests, and give them something special,” says Eddy. Mission accomplished.

Flavor: hot (and sometimes sweet); aromatic, with pungent notes of cloves, lemon, and/or wood



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Look for tellicherry black peppercorns, which are often regarded as the best in the world for their rich, complex flavor. Pepper suggests “false heat,” and also stimulates the appetite. Always use freshly ground black pepper from a pepper mill for optimal flavor. Add at the very last minute before serving.

“I think black pepper and the whole rainbow of peppercorns are among the most underrated spices in the kitchen. Peppercorns are truly berries—they are sweet, fruity, and spicy—so a great pepper adds a lot of flavor. I’ve served cauliflower crusted with pepper, and the pepper helped the cauliflower sing on the plate.”

“My personal preference is to serve fruit only at the end of a meal, but persimmons are an exception: They are not too sweet, and not too overwhelming in flavor, so they are easy to use at other points in a meal. I’ve served a mid-menu dish of chilled persimmon with tofu paste, and I also think sesame paste accents it well.”

POMEGRANATES and POMEGRANATE JUICE (see also POMEGRANATE MOLASSES)


Season: autumn



Flavor: sour/sweet, with notes of cranberries, and juicy, crunchy seeds (when fresh)



Volume: moderate (fresh seeds)



Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 12% fats / 7% protein



Calories: 75 per ½-cup serving (fresh seeds)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: juice, raw



Tips: While the season for fresh pomegranates is short, the fruit freezes well (e.g., whole, in a zip-locked plastic bag). Just thaw, cut open, and remove the delicious, juicy seeds to add to smoothies and other dishes, all year long.

Season: winter



Flavor: sour/sweet, with grapefruit notes (although milder, sweeter, and juicier than grapefruit)



Volume: loud



What it is: citrus fruit





POPCORN, e.g., air-popped


What it is: whole grain



What’s healthful about it: high in fiber, low in calories (when air-popped)



Tips: Opt for organic popcorn, as non-organic popcorn is on the USDA’s top 10 list of foods contaminated with toxic chemicals and pesticides. Spritz with a little soy sauce for flavor and saltiness—or with a little olive oil and a sprinkle of cheesy-tasting nutritional yeast for a dose of vitamin B12.

Washington Post food editor Joe Yonan, author of Eat Your Vegetables, created his own version of the addictive herbed popcorn produced by Seventh-day Adventist vegetarian restaurant Little Lad’s, which features oil-popped popcorn seasoned with nutritional yeast, dried oregano, dried dill, dried thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, and an optional shake of fine sea salt.

POTATOES—IN GENERAL, WITH SKIN


Season: year-round, esp. summer–winter



Flavor: neutral, with earthy notes, and a starchy texture



Volume: quiet



What they are: vegetable—starchy



Nutritional profile: 93% carbs / 6% protein / 1% fats



Calories: 70 per ½-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake (whole, wrapped in foil, at 400°F, about 50–60 minutes), boil (note: use the leftover, nutritious water for sauces, soups), deep-fry, fry, grill, mash (esp. older, starchier potatoes), puree, roast (quartered, 20–40 minutes at 400°F), sauté, steam, stuff



Tips: Opt for organic potatoes. Leave the skins on for extra flavor, texture, and nutrition. Scrub well before cooking. Boil potatoes whole, not cut, so they don’t absorb water. Before baking potatoes, poke with a fork several times so steam can escape. Potatoes are America’s favorite vegetable (especially as French fries!), but don’t forget the importance of enjoying a wide variety of vegetables to ensure yourself the benefits of an equally wide variety of nutrients.

PRESSURE-COOKING


Tip: Cooks foods 50–70 percent faster than traditional methods—which is especially helpful when it comes to slow-cooking foods such as dried beans and grains.





“I love pressure-cooking beans and grains, not only because it’s faster but because it makes them more digestible. Chickpeas that would normally take hours and hours of boiling will be done in 60 minutes in a pressure-cooker. The only beans I won’t pressure-cook are white beans, because it makes them too mushy for our arugula salad that features them. And you shouldn’t pressure-cook split peas or soybeans because they foam, which can clog the mechanism and make it explode—something I unfortunately learned the hard way after just painting my kitchen.… Brown rice can pressure-cook in just 40 minutes, and only needs a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio, because you don’t need much liquid when pressure-cooking.”

—PAM BROWN, GARDEN CAFÉ ON THE GREEN (WOODSTOCK, NY)

“With up to 9 grams of protein per half-cup serving, pulses offer a low-fat or fat-free alternative to animal proteins. Pulses improve the protein quality of cereal grains, by adding a complimentary amino acid profile. Due to the high nutrient density, pulses can be considered both a protein and a vegetable.”

QUINOA


[KEEN-wah]



Flavor: bitter/slightly sweet, with earthy notes of couscous, grass, herbs, millet, nuts, and/or sesame, and a light and fluffy (when cooked), slightly crunchy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: often thought of as a whole grain, even though it’s the fruit of an herb, not a grain



What’s healthful about it: Most quinoa contains 15–20% protein (higher than the typical 14% of wheat, 9–11% of millet, and 7–8% of rice), and is richer in calcium than milk.



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 71% carbs / 15% protein / 14% fat



Calories: 220 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 8 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Cooks in 10–15 (white) to 20 (red) to 30 (black) minutes.



Ratio: 1: 1½–2 (1 cup quinoa to 1½–2 cups liquid, e.g., stock, water)



Tips: Quinoa must be rinsed very well before cooking, to remove all traces of bitterness (and “suds” from the rinse water). Toast first before using in dishes to enhance its flavor. For enhanced flavor and texture, try sautéing for 5 minutes before adding liquid—and/or substituting vegetable stock or juice, or fruit juice (e.g., orange or passion fruit), for some or all of the water. Fluff with a fork after cooking to separate the grains (and remember that black and red quinoa won’t stick together as much as white). Quinoa doesn’t get mushy, even when overcooked.

“Eating plain white quinoa can be like eating bird food. What I like to do is mix it with red and black quinoa, which gives you great flavor and texture with some nuttiness and chew to it.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB RESTAURANT (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love quinoa. I especially like making quinoa tabbolueh. I add onions, tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, lemon, and salt. You don’t have to cook it that long and it absorbs all the flavors.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Every ingredient in our dishes is there for a reason—either flavor, texture, and/or its health benefit. Quinoa is kind of our ‘house grain’ because of all of the above—it’s great in salads, and golden quinoa is one of two key ingredients [along with black beans] in our signature Root veggie burger. Our burgers are also made with pureed carrots, garlic, onions, and breadcrumbs seasoned with black pepper and paprika before shaping into patties. To achieve their meaty texture, they’re cooked twice—the first time slowly on low heat on the grill, and the second time seared on high heat to crisp it.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)

“I’ll slice watermelon radishes so that they cook through—they turn so red they look almost bloody. I toss them in butter, and add them to parsnip dishes, or salads. I’ll also pickle them to make kimchi.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)

RICE, ARBORIO (aka RISOTTO)


Flavor: neutral, with a firm chalky center and a starchy, creamy surface (when cooked)



Volume: quiet



Techniques: Sauté rice in butter or oil until white. Stir while gradually adding hot/boiling liquid (e.g., vegetable stock) and simmering, about 20 minutes.



Ratio: 1: 3–3½ (1 cup rice to 3–3½ cups cooking liquid, e.g., juice, stock, water, and/or wine)



Tips: Let the seasons inspire your risotto pairings, e.g., basil and tomato in summer, wild mushrooms in autumn. Try the same flavor pairings with “risottos” made from other grains, e.g., barley, farro. Look for brown Arborio rice, which is higher in nutrients.



Possible substitutes: baldo rice, carnaroli rice (which, while less widely available, makes the creamiest—and arguably the best—risotto), vialone nano rice

RICE, BASMATI, and BROWN BASMATI RICE


Flavor: slightly sweet; aromatic, with notes of nuts, popcorn, smoke, and/or toast, and a firm, slightly chewy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: aged long-grain rice



Techniques: boil, simmer (about 2 minutes), steam

RICE, BROWN—IN GENERAL


Flavor: nutty, with a chewy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: whole grain



Nutritional profile: 87% carbs / 7% protein / 6% fat



Calories: 220 per 1-cup serving (medium-grain, cooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Timing: Cook at a low boil, covered, for about 30–50 minutes, until tender.



Ratio: 1:2 (1 cup brown rice to 2 cups of cooking liquid)

ROOT VEGETABLES—IN GENERAL, or MIXED (see also BEETS, CARROTS, PARSNIPS, RUTABAGAS, SWEET POTATOES, TURNIPS, etc.)



“I’ll confit root vegetables—like carrots, celery root, parsley root, and parsnips—that have been shaved thin on a mandoline in olive oil with herbs, spices, and citrus for six to eight hours in an 85°F oven, which breaks down their cell wall structure. As they become tender, their water is replaced with fat. I strain and puree them, which creates the texture of room-temperature butter. Because this ‘root vegetable butter’ has the same qualities as butter or soft cheese, I can use it in similar ways, such as on canapés or to bind other ingredients.”

“Anytime you combine rosemary and thyme, you’ve got instant Thanksgiving! Their soulful, dark, rich flavors will enhance anything, from a bag of chips to a mushroom dish. But rosemary is very pungent, so you only need a little. I won’t add rosemary to a soup: by the time rosemary turns gray, it’s given everything it has to give, and you want it out of there anyway. Instead, I’ll use a rosemary branch to stir the soup and infuse the flavor.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





RUTABAGAS


Season: autumn–spring



Flavor: sweet/sometimes bitter, with sometimes sharp, peppery, and/or pungent notes of cabbage, nuts, and/or turnips, and a crisp texture

What they are: root vegetables



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 9% protein / 5% fats



Calories: 70 per 1-cup serving (cooked, cubed)



Protein: 2 grams

“Every dish needs a vibrant quality about it. In a leafy green salad, when you toss it and serve it, it doesn’t have the leaves all upside down so their backs are to someone. I call it ‘fluffy and lofty’—the greens twins—that make the salad inviting. If you list a bunch of ingredients in the salad, don’t hide them all at the bottom. Make sure the stand-out ingredients stand out. And don’t go cheap: three extra cherry tomatoes is not going to break the bank. You want a person to feel that you care every step of the way.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)





The Secret to Loving Salads: A Great Salad Dressing


One of the most healthful and flavorful changes you can make to your diet is to eat more vegetables—a lot more vegetables. At least half of them should be eaten raw, such as in salads. Keeping things flavorful through mastering a compelling array of salad dressings is a worthwhile pursuit.

Don’t undo the good you’ve done by using typical oil-laden dressings, which clock in at nearly 120 calories per tablespoon (like pure fat itself). Below are some ways to cut calories and fat without eliminating flavor:


Ratio: The standard radio is 1:3 or 1:4 (1 part vinegar to 3 or 4 parts oil), but consider minimizing (if not eliminating) oil in salad dressings.


Tips: Always start the process of making salad dressing with the vinegar and/or citrus (e.g., lemon, lime, orange) juice and seasonings (e.g., citrus zest, herbs; minced garlic, onions, or shallots; spices), and slowly whisk in any oil. If too much oil is added, the flavor balance will be lost. For more Omega-3s, consider substituting flaxseed or walnut oil for part of the extra-virgin olive oil. With citrus vinaigrettes, use a lighter vinegar, e.g., champagne, rice, or sherry. Those looking to minimize or eliminate oil can base salad dressings on other liquids or pastes, such as buttermilk, fruit juice, kefir, nut butters, tahini, vegetable juice or stock, vinegar, yogurt, and/or water—or even pureed fruit, silken tofu, or vegetables (e.g., avocados). To make vegetarian dressings creamier, add a little cream cheese, fresh goat cheese, kefir, mascarpone, or ricotta; vegans can blend with nutritional yeast or silken tofu.

Not only great for salads, the combinations listed in this section can also be used for dips, dipping sauces, marinades, sautés, or stir-fries—or drizzled over hot vegetables, Asian noodles, or pastas.





Talking with Charleen Badman of FnB in Scottsdale about Making a Great Salad


For a great salad, you need the elements of crunch, sweetness, savoriness, and fattiness.

Crunch: “For crunch in a salad, I can use a variety of things beyond nuts. I like to use things in the onion family—for example, julienning and salting onions, and frying them in olive oil. Leeks and shallots both crisp up well and can be used as a garnish. I also like using puffed rice to add texture.”

Sweetness: “Sweetness can be added with fresh fruits, like apples or pears; dried fruits like raisins; or even sweet vegetables like corn or tomatoes.”

Savoriness: “Adding some spice is also a great way to enhance a salad. You can do it with some chili pepper or even raw fresh ginger, which tastes great with rutabaga.”

Fattiness: “To add fat, there are many options. You can select a fatty vegetable, like an avocado. You can use a mayonnaise turned into aioli. Cheese is good in dressings, as are infused olive oils.”

SALT—IN GENERAL



“Because of my French training, fleur de sel is one of the salts I rely on most. Its flavor is perfect with tomatoes. I’ll use Malden sea salt, which has lots of notes of the ocean, for dishes like roasted root vegetables. Sel gris, which often comes in blue bottles, is strong, and not as fine as other salts. I have nothing against kosher salt, but its flavor is just not what I’m used to working with.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)





SALT, BLACK


Flavor: salty; pungent with notes of eggs and/or sulphur



Volume: very loud



What it is: pinkish-gray Indian mineral salt



Tips: Look for Indian kala namak. Adds a boiled egg flavor to vegan dishes (e.g., tofu scrambles, “egg salads” made with tofu). Caution: A little goes a long way! Grind it fine to use in the smallest doses.

Calories: 105 calories per 1-ounce serving (vital wheat gluten)



Protein: 21 grams



Techniques: bake, barbecue, fry, grill, marinate, pan-sear, sauté, sear, steam, stew, stir-fry



Tips: For peak flavor, be sure to marinate the seitan for at least a few hours. Add texture through seasoned crusts, e.g., herbs, panko. Use seitan “scraps” for sauces, soups, taco fillings. Seitan also freezes well.

You can easily make your own seitan from scratch with vital wheat gluten, seasoning it to taste (e.g., as you would making your own chorizo or gyros). However, if you’re just getting started, you might try one of Arrowhead Mills’s quick mixes or a Knox Mountain mix. You can also find commercially prepared seitan from national brands like Lightlife and WhiteWave, or local producers like The Bridge (Middleton, CT).

“Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are the holy trinity of vegetarianism. Seitan is my favorite because of its versatility.”

—JOY PIERSON, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I love serving seitan with a crunchy crust, such as crushed cashews, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, or even quinoa. Instead of egg wash, we’ll dip the seitan in a vegan mixture of water, lemon juice, garlic, and nutritional yeast before crusting and sautéing.”

—ANGEL RAMOS, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I don’t know of any other vegetarian restaurant that offered a vegetarian Reuben sandwich before we did. Ours is made with a seitan-based pastrami ‘wheat meat,’ a little sauerkraut, spicy mustard, Thousand Island dressing, and Vegenaise on oversized Jewish rye bread, which you can get with either Swiss cheese, vegan cheese, or—my favorite—cottage-style tofu, which is mashed tofu seasoned with garlic, chives, and onions. I’ve probably eaten two hundred of them over the past ten years. In the beginning, we used to make our Reubens with vegetarian bacon bits, which softened on the sandwich, which was spread with a layer of Vegenaise. But the seitan version is more authentic.”

SMOKING


Tips: It doesn’t take more than 30–60 seconds in a smoker to add a smoked flavor to many foods. You definitely don’t want to oversmoke foods, which makes them bitter and leaves an unpleasant brownish coating. Experiment with various woods for different flavors, but you’ll typically want to lean toward lighter woods like apple and cherry (which are sweeter), or perhaps oak and pecan (which are a bit louder), rather than hickory, maple, and mesquite (which are much more pronounced and can easily overwhelm fruits and vegetables).





Brand: Nordic Ware and other companies for small stovetop/grilltop smokers




“I like smoked flavors and smoke lots of different fruits and vegetables. Smoked lettuce has the flavor of a grilled hamburger. It’s comical how convincing it can be: Customers have accused us of putting bacon into our smoked potato puree dish, which evokes bacon and eggs. We’ll smoke garlic or onions and puree them for sauces—or to add a bacony note to pasta alla carbonara. Customers automatically expect raisins to taste dry, chewy, and sweet—but serving them raisins that have been pickled then smoked will make them think again.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“Sometimes I’ll add a little tequila to a black bean sauce to give it a unique smoky flavor—a sauce that would be delicious with chile-grilled seitan with collard greens and sweet plantains.”

—ANGEL RAMOS, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)

SMOOTHIES (see also JUICES)


What they are: differentiated from juices in that they contain fiber, which makes them creamy and more nutritious.



Tips: When in doubt, add a banana for texture and flavor; they combine well with many other fruits and even vegetables. For richer-tasting smoothies, use frozen fruit.





“Smoothies made with tropical fruits will hide the flavor of strong greens. One of our most popular smoothies is the Island Green, which is made with coconut, coconut water, cucumber, kale, mango, pineapple, spinach, and strawberries.”

—CASSIE AND MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)




“The seasons are an inspiration to all of us here. One autumn, I came up with an ideal seasonal treat: a sweet potato smoothie flavored with maple syrup, almond milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Every fall, we bring it back!”

—MARK DOSKOW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)

“Zucchini ‘noodles’ are soft and pliable—especially if blanched in lemon juice, which gives them a soft ‘cooked’ texture—making them the #1 raw pasta option. While using a spiralizer produces a more realistic noodle, using a mandoline is fine if you’re pressed for time.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)





SPIRALING or SPIRALIZING


Use a spiral slicer to create “pasta” (e.g., “angel hair,” “linguini,” “spaghetti”) or thin ribbons out of hard vegetables (e.g., beets, carrots, celery root, daikon, jícama, kohlrabi, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, zucchini) or even fruits (e.g., apples). To soften, toss with a bit of oil and salt (or sauté very briefly) before saucing or adding to soup.


Possible substitutes: julienne peelers, mandolines

“I’ll use a spiralizer to make ‘noodles’ like vermicelli from raw kohlrabi or zucchini or other vegetables. Just massage them with a little oil and salt, and in just one minute, the noodles are no longer crunchy but chewy.”

“Spiralized jícama looks like pho noodles. I’ll add them to a vegetarian pho [Vietnamese noodle soup], or a mushroom curry made with roasted shiitakes and purple sweet potatoes, with the red curry sauce poured tableside.”

“When I see ramps come in, I know there is light at the end of the tunnel—and that I will not be using squash and potatoes much longer! I look forward to spring’s asparagus and morels, which grow in the Midwest. When June hits, it is strawberry season.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“In the spring, asparagus is the first thing to roll in, then the peas, followed by the fava beans. We are lucky and spoiled here at Greens because we get great produce all year and we know it. It would be hard to do what we do anywhere else!”

“We’ve juiced butternut squash to add color and flavor to risotto. I don’t like the mouthfeel that results from drying and powdering the [leftover] mulch to flavor dishes. But I’ve made a butternut squash chutney out of adding the juice back to the mulch and seasoning it with cardamom, garlic, star anise, sugar, and vinegar.”

SQUASH, SPAGHETTI


Season: late summer–winter



Flavor: slightly sweet, with the texture of crunchy (if stringy) spaghetti



Volume: quiet–moderate



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 8% fats / 6% protein



Calories: 45 per 1-cup serving (boiled or baked)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake (at 350°F about 30–90 minutes), boil (about 30–60 minutes), roast (at 400°F for 15–20 minutes), sauté, steam (20–45 minutes, until tender)



Tips: Spaghetti squash is named after the appearance of its cooked flesh, whose strands resemble the pasta. You can bake it whole (as some insist on), after puncturing it in a few places to allow steam to escape, or halved (as Andrew taught me). Use a fork to pull off strands of cooked squash. Toss or top with sauce and serve like spaghetti. Although spaghetti squash can be found as early as late summer, look to pairing tips for winter squash, which its flavor more closely resembles.

STOCK, VEGETABLE (see also DASHI)


Tips: Vegetable stock is a great staple to have on hand as a base for grains, legumes, marinades, rices, risottos, sauces, or soups. It’s easy to make by simmering your favorite combination of several of the vegetables and seasonings below with water. To make a louder version, roast the vegetables first. As a low-fat substitute, use vegetable stock instead of oil when sautéing or stir-frying foods.

“Our tapioca puddings are so popular that it’s hard to take them off our menu. Coconut milk is a source of both flavor and richness [as opposed to rice milk, which is thin and has no flavor, or soy milk, which can taste chalky]. We thicken the pudding with agar-agar, which doesn’t mask flavors, unlike cornstarch. We like to accent it with fruit in both raw and cooked form, such as fresh cherries with a cherry sauce or gel.”

Flavor: slightly sweet/bitter, with earthy notes of mushrooms, nuts, smoke, and/or yeast, and a firm, chewy, meaty texture



Volume: moderate–loud



What it is: soybeans that have been fermented with a grain or grains (e.g., rice, barley, millet) and formed into cakes; weightier than tofu



Nutritional profile: 47% fats / 33% protein / 20% carbs



Calories: 160 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 15 grams



Techniques: bake (at 350°F about 30 minutes), braise, broil (4–5 minutes per side), fry, grate, grill (4–5 minutes per side), pan-fry (10 minutes), roast, sauté, steam, stir-fry (Note: Be sure to cook thoroughly.)



Tips: Steam for 10 minutes to calm tempeh’s bitterness. After steaming, make sure to properly marinate (at least 30 minutes) and season for optimal flavor.

“Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are the holy trinity of vegetarianism.… Tempeh is my favorite because it has the most nutrients.”

—BART POTENZA, COFOUNDER, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I prefer soy tempeh in the summertime, because it pairs well with lighter flavors like citrus, lemon, and white wine. When the weather cools down in the fall, I prefer multigrain tempeh because its earthier flavor pairs better with the season’s richer flavors of mushrooms and spices like cinnamon. I really like Surata [brand] tempeh’s texture and flavor.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I prefer tempeh to tofu or seitan because it is heartier and stands up to flavorful sauces like mole the best.”

—ANGEL RAMOS, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)

THANKSGIVING



“If you ask people what they love about Thanksgiving food, the answer is usually what we think of as the ‘sides.’ It’s all about the herbs and spices; the sage in the stuffing and the ginger in the squash; the thyme in the gravy and the pepper in the potatoes. There are so many ways to build satisfying flavors for the holiday table. I love a nice centerpiece of course, perhaps a pot pie or a lentil roast, but I think that making sure that all of the familiar flavors are present is the most important part of the holiday table.”

THICKENING AGENTS


When you can’t or don’t want to rely on butter and cream to thicken dishes, consider these options:



agar-agar (although this works better as a gelatin substitute)

arrowroot powder

cornstarch

kudzu root (aka kuzu)





THYME


Season: summer



Flavor: bitter/sweet; aromatic, with earthy/pungent notes of caraway, cloves, flowers, herbs, lemon, mint, orange, and/or pine



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Opt for fresh rather than dried thyme. Add at the end of the cooking process to retain flavor. Lemon thyme has more citrus notes than regular thyme.

TOFU—IN GENERAL


[TOH-foo]



Flavor: neutral, ranging from delicate to firm in texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: bean curd made from soybeans



Nutritional profile: 50% fats / 38% protein / 12% carbs (raw, firm)



Calories: 185 per ½-cup serving (raw, firm)



Protein: 20 grams (raw, firm)



Techniques: bake (at 350°F for 15 minutes per side), blanch (esp. before long simmering), boil (10 minutes), braise, broil, crumble, cube, freeze (after defrosting, chewiness is enhanced), fry, grill (4–5 minutes per side), marinate, pan-sear, puree, roast, sauté, slice, simmer (20 minutes), stir-fry, tempura-fry, toast



Tips: Its flavor neutrality is a boon, as tofu readily absorbs the flavors with which it is cooked. Tofu is solidified using nigari or lemon juice, so flavors that pair well with lemon often work beautifully. Rinse tofu in cold water before using, and drain well to better allow tofu to absorb seasonings. You can press out the excess water from tofu by using paper towels and heavy books or cans, but frequent tofu cooks might consider investing in a tofu press (e.g., TofuXpress).

TOFU, FIRM or EXTRA-FIRM


Flavor: neutral, with a texture that is denser and heartier than silken, yet moister than super-firm tofu



Volume: quiet



Nutritional profile: 54% fat / 38% protein / 8% carbs



Calories: 85 per -block serving (extra-firm)



Protein: 9 grams (extra-firm)



Techniques: bake, crumble, deep-fry, fry, grate (esp. extra-firm), grill, marinate, pan-fry, roast, sauté, scramble, stir-fry



Tips: Marinate overnight or for as long as several days. For a chewier texture, freeze firm or extra-firm tofu for 24+ hours, then thaw, and squeeze out water in tofu before marinating; the texture can approximate that of ground beef or chicken in dishes such as vegetarian chili or tacos. Crumble and season (e.g., with basil, garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, oregano, salt) extra-firm tofu to make a vegan ricotta cheese substitute that can be used in pastas and on pizzas.

“I like extra-firm tofu with tapenade and tomatoes. If you put extra-firm tofu through your food processor, it will come out the texture of ricotta cheese, and you can use it that way in lasagnas and other pasta dishes.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)





TOFU, FROZEN


Tips: Freezing firm or extra-firm tofu changes its texture. Once thawed and cooked, it has a chewy, meaty texture. Cubed, it approximates the texture of meat. Crumbled, it approximates the texture of ground beef.

pizzas

sauces, e.g., tomato

TOFU, JAPANESE


Tip: Use when you’re looking for the softest texture.





TOFU, SCRAMBLED


Tips: Substitute crumbled firm or extra-firm tofu for scrambled eggs as a base to mix in vegetables and seasonings, e.g., avocados, bell peppers, black beans, cilantro, garlic, mushrooms, onions, parsley, scallions, spinach, tempeh bacon, tomatoes, or vegan sausage. Achieve the yellow hue of scrambled eggs via nutritional yeast or turmeric.





TOFU, SILKEN


Flavor: slightly sweet, with a creamy, moist, smooth, custard-like texture



Volume: quiet



Tips: Puree into sauces and soups to give them a creamy texture. Blend silken tofu with agave nectar and/or maple syrup plus vanilla for a vegan topping to enjoy on French toast, pancakes, or waffles—or on desserts. Do not substitute silken for regular tofu, or vice versa; use the type specified by the particular recipe.

“Tofu is so versatile! You can use it as a savory element to make a mousse or a veggie burger. If you marinate it, you can use it like a cheese and add it to salads. I add soy milk and silken tofu to polenta, then serve it with broccoli rabe. I like to marinate tofu with turmeric or with raw onion, sherry vinegar, red or green pepper, and soy sauce. Easiest of all is marinating a whole block of tofu in miso, then baking it for 20 minutes—it comes out with such a great flavor, and is even better with some brown rice and broccoli rabe.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Island Spring is the Cadillac of tofu. It takes time to develop a great product, and theirs is dense and flavorful and absorbs other flavors well.… I like to grill my tofu before marinating it, because citrus tears apart the fiber and makes it impossible to char afterward. Marinating grilled tofu pushes the flavor of the char and the marinade into the tofu.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“Our spin on tuna with wasabi is spicy grilled tofu taken in a Korean direction with gochujang, which is the paste used in bibambap. The gochujang is a little sharp, so we add bean paste for a sweet balance that is turned into a glaze to finish the tofu.”

—RICH LANDAU AND KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

OIL, CANOLA


Flavor: neutral



Volume: quiet



What it is: rapeseed oil from CANada (which is where it gets its name)



Techniques: bake, fry, sauté



Tips: Use only organic, expeller-pressed canola oil, as many canola oils are made from GMO seeds; otherwise, opt for another oil altogether. Use as fresh as possible, and check regularly for rancidity (as it goes rancid quickly). Canola oil can be used for medium- (e.g., baking) to high-temperature (e.g., frying) cooking. Use with boldly flavored dishes that would obscure the flavor of more expensive oils.

“I’ll blend coconut oil with cacao powder to make raw truffles, while I use coconut butter in raw desserts.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“The choice of oil in baking is important. For cookies I will use canola, grapeseed, or coconut oil. The coconut oil is used in our doughnuts and cakes as well, but you have to be careful so that the flavor does not become overpowering.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Coconut oil is a liquid when it’s at 72°F and up, and a solid with the texture of butter or shortening at temperatures below 72°F. When we make biscuits, we’ll use solid coconut oil and cut it into the dough, which results in a layering effect and flakier biscuits. We’ll also cut solid coconut oil into our pancake batter, where it has a leavening effect that makes our pancakes light and fluffy—more so than with canola oil.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)





OIL, FLAXSEED


What’s healthful about it: omega-3 fatty acids



Tips: Flaxseeds are said to be even higher in lignans than flaxseed oil is. Heating flaxseed oil destroys its nutrients. Store in the refrigerator.

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, HAZELNUT


Flavor: notes of hazelnuts



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Use for low- to medium-temperature cooking (e.g., baking, sautéing), or as a finishing oil. Use caution when cooking, as hazelnut oil burns easily. Store in the refrigerator, and use within a few months after opening.

Flavor: earthy notes of fruit and/or olives, with a rich texture



Volume: quieter (e.g., lighter-colored virgin)–louder (e.g., deeper-colored extra-virgin)



Techniques: bake, fry, raw, sauté (on low heat)



Tips: Use raw, or warm only to low temperatures. Opt for lighter, quieter virgin (aka “pure”) oil for baking, frying, grilling, roasting, and sautéing, and darker, louder extra-virgin oil for dressing salads or drizzling on bruschetta or pizza. For salad dressings, the typical ratio is one part vinegar to three or four parts extra-virgin olive oil, but those looking to lower the fat in their diets (not to mention calories) should consider using less oil.

“I can sum up in two words the difference between vegetarian cooking in the 1970s vs. today: olive oil. Back then, it was common to mask dishes with the richness of butter and cream. Olive oil lets more of the flavor shine through, particularly dishes made with garlic and herbs.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR




“One you’ve fallen in love with the flavor of extra-virgin olive oil, there’s no place to go after that. I’ll only use it to finish dishes. For high-heat cooking, I use canola, grapeseed, or safflower oil—or some combination thereof.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

ORGANIC PRODUCE


Tip: Opt for organic produce whenever possible—and definitely when you buy one of the Environmental Working Group (EWG)’s so-called “Dirty Dozen Plus” fruits or vegetables, which are those most affected by chemical contamination, i.e., apples, bell peppers, celery, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers, collard greens, cucumbers, grapes, kale, nectarines (imported), peaches, potatoes, spinach, strawberries, and summer squash.



The EWG notes that “[t]he health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure. Use EWG’s Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides™ to reduce your exposures as much as possible, but eating conventionally-grown produce is far better than not eating fruits and vegetables at all.”

“I love parsley as a flavor. Parsley risotto is amazing, and its color is as vibrant as its flavor. There is more to parsley than just the leaf; I use the stems and roots as well. The stems add good texture, and I use them to add crunch to soups. As for the root, which has an herbaceousness similar to parsnips, I like to roast and puree them for soups as well.… People also need to remember that there is more than flat-leaf parsley out there. I am a fan of curly parsley, which is often overlooked and has an intense, almost celery-like flavor. There was a time in America when you couldn’t serve a plate without the orange wedge and curly parsley.”

“If I’m serving a smooth pureed parsnip soup, I’ll layer other parsnip flavors into the dish—for example, both cooked and raw parsnips, fried parsnip chips, and a confited parsnip ‘butter.’ I’ll keep working to think of new ways to get more parsnip flavor into the dish one more time—like taking the parsnip oil from confited parsnips and reemulsifying it back into the soup. All together, the flavor becomes so much more impactful.”

“There are entire regions of Italy that make pasta without eggs. Gnocchi is made without eggs in Liguria [so it’s naturally vegan]. I don’t use eggs in my ravioli dough—I use tapioca flour. I sometimes stuff ravioli with thick cashew cream, or kale, or a vegetable puree. I’ve served English pea ravioli with morels, mint, lemon zest, and sweated shallots.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)

Talking with Chef Chris Eddy of Winvian about Cooking for Vegetarians


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was a simple vegetarian pappardelle dish I was served at Winvian, a unique Connecticut resort that houses eighteen individually designed cottages, including a helicopter and a treehouse. It featured a green sauce, along with sautéed cauliflower, mushrooms, and onions, and a very light dusting of grated cheese on top. The creamy sauce turned out to be a steamed broccoli puree made in a Vitamix with a bit of ice (“to cool the broccoli as quickly as possible,” according to chef Chris Eddy), some clear vegetable stock (“so as not to interfere with the beautiful green color”), a hint of heat in the form of either cayenne or chili pepper flakes (“always—it’s a ‘calling card’ that leaves an impression even after you’ve finished eating”), and just a touch of brown butter (“to add an amazing dimension to the sauce”). It’s based on a “ridiculously simple” technique Eddy learned while working with Chef Alain Ducasse and, I can attest, it’s ridiculously delicious.

Eddy says the technique works just as well with other vegetables—whether cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, or parsnips—and if added richness is desired, one could substitute cream for some of the clear vegetable stock (“although its whiteness fades the bright colors”), though the dish is creamy and rich even without added cream.

While Eddy characterizes Winvian’s customers as about 35 to 40 percent pescetarian, he and chef de cuisine Patrick Espinoza and their kitchen team spent a month eating vegetarian during the summer of 2013, just for the experience of putting themselves into the shoes of the significant portion of Winvian’s clientele (“about 7 or 8 percent of our customers”) who eat vegetarian. Why? “Number one, we love vegetables,” Eddy admits. But out of compassion for Winvian’s vegetarian customers, “We wanted to ‘feel their pain.’ We came to understand their frustration [at other restaurants] of only being offered the same dishes again and again—whether eggplant Parmesan, or risotto, or a salad—when they went out to dine.” In addition to prompting Eddy and his team to come up with an ever-changing array of dishes like the incredible pappardelle I fell in love with, their month-long vegetarian experiment had an added bonus: a number of Eddy’s cooks discovered that they felt healthier and sometimes less irritable.

“Now, we like to go all out for our vegetarian guests, and give them something special,” says Eddy. Mission accomplished.

Tips: Look for tellicherry black peppercorns, which are often regarded as the best in the world for their rich, complex flavor. Pepper suggests “false heat,” and also stimulates the appetite. Always use freshly ground black pepper from a pepper mill for optimal flavor. Add at the very last minute before serving.

“I think black pepper and the whole rainbow of peppercorns are among the most underrated spices in the kitchen. Peppercorns are truly berries—they are sweet, fruity, and spicy—so a great pepper adds a lot of flavor. I’ve served cauliflower crusted with pepper, and the pepper helped the cauliflower sing on the plate.”

“My personal preference is to serve fruit only at the end of a meal, but persimmons are an exception: They are not too sweet, and not too overwhelming in flavor, so they are easy to use at other points in a meal. I’ve served a mid-menu dish of chilled persimmon with tofu paste, and I also think sesame paste accents it well.”

“I love chard! I love cooking the stems of rainbow chard, which have so much flavor. Just slice them and toss them in hot olive oil for one or two minutes, then add the greens, some garlic, some water or stock, and salt and pepper, and let them cook another two or three minutes. You can finish them with almonds, pine nuts, or pumpkin seeds for a little texture—and a shake of chili pepper flakes if you want a little kick.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)



“What we do here is build flavors: For example, we will stew chard with onions, garlic, and other traditional stewing ingredients that are really tasty, and then dehydrate some of it and turn it into a powder that will get worked into a gnocchi or pasta dough. It is a seasoning component that you would use about 5 percent in the dough. Next, you take the chard you didn’t dehydrate and put that in the dish with the gnocchi on top. We will also fry some chard as a garnish. All of the sudden, the chard takes on a whole level of flavor because we have incorporated it into different forms within the dish. So when people eat it, they say, ‘Wow—I have never tasted chard like this!’ This happens because we did not simply sauté some chard; we manipulated it, thought it through, and gave it back to you on a dish in a whole multitude of ways.”

Say (Vegan) Cheese!


Many vegans enjoy Daiya or Follow Your Heart brand vegan cheeses, which come in various flavors (e.g., cheddar, mozzarella) and often melt and stretch much as dairy cheese does.

I have been more impressed with the flavor of the artisanal vegan cheeses I’ve tasted, such as those at Pure Food and Wine in Manhattan. Portobello in Portland, Oregon, serves an artisanal vegan cheese plate that showcases cheeses from cheese-makers across the country, including Field Roast, Seattle-based producer of Chao Cheese (herb-crusted, tofu-based cheeses), Door 86 (Nashville), Heidi Ho (Portland, OR), Kite Hill (Hayward, CA), Punk Rawk Labs (Minneapolis), and Treeline Treenut Cheese (Kingston, NY).

Interested in making your own? Check out Miyoko Schinner’s 2012 book Artisan Vegan Cheese, which is developing a cult following among vegan chefs and foodies.

“When cherries come in, I love to use them in savory dishes. I like to pair them with a creamy burrata, which is a nice textural contrast. I might use them in a gastrique to create a sweet and sour flavor to play off the creaminess of the cheese. Cherries are also great with grains like farro or freekeh with lots of lemon. I like cherries with sweeter herbs like chervil or parsley, and they are great with basil. Cherries pair well with nuts, but since they’re used with almonds so much, I will pair them with black walnuts.”

“I spent two years in Hong Kong and found what they were doing with vegetarian food was very inspiring. At the time there was nowhere [in North America] to eat vegetarian food unless you wanted ‘hippy and crunchy.’ But in Hong Kong, it was natural because people ate vegetarian once or more a week and it was not considered weird. The flavors they were able to coax from meatless ingredients were amazing.”

“I love fresh young coconut meat, even plain. But if you add avocado and lime, you can make a pudding to die for! And you can also take it savory by making a ‘beef jerky’ from dehydrated coconut blended with cayenne, liquid smoke, and raw agave or maple syrup—it’s incredible.”

“Corn is a religion where I grew up [in the New York Finger Lakes region]. We treat corn like the French treat their baguettes. You don’t eat the baguettes you bought in the morning for dinner! Likewise, you buy and serve corn as fresh as possible. Corn is all about timing because it loses fifty percent of its sweetness after harvest. Farmers pick corn three times a day: at seven in the morning, at noon, and at three. Seven a.m. is the best, but you have to eat it for lunch. You buy your three o’clock corn for dinner. I like it simple: corn, butter, and salt. My wife Isabel [Bogadtke] likes her corn with lime and cumin seeds.”

—CHRISTOPHER BATES, HOTEL FAUCHERE (MILFORD, PA)




“Corn is the one ingredient I work with best, and I get a non-GMO corn so it tastes great. I will focus in on it, and it will end up being the favorite of both our guests and our servers. I made a chilled corn soup that people loved: I cut the corn off the cob, made corn milk, made a stock out of corn cobs, sautéed the corn in a bunch of onion, thyme, and garlic, then added the corn milk and stock. I reduced it, pureed it all together, and added some half and half. I served the soup with shaved radishes and parsley. It’s great because it is a cold soup when it is hot out, with the peppery radishes cutting the richness of the soup and an accent of vegetal green parsley rounding out the flavor and bringing it all together.”

“The way Jean-Georges Vongerichten thinks about flavors is exceptional. I made his recipe for Brussels sprouts [with toasted pecans and avocado] that appeared in Food and Wine, and it was amazingly good.”

—SELMA MIRIAM, BLOODROOT (BRIDGEPORT, CT)




“In mainstream restaurants, you’ll inevitably see Brussels sprouts served with bacon. We serve them with smoked tofu, whose smokiness serves as the ‘bacon,’ accented by the sweetness of orange juice and a hint of agave plus the umami of miso.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)

“Theo Schoenegger [of Sinatra Restaurant in Las Vegas] is awesome and is one of the best Italian chefs working in America. He is also one of the most open-minded people I have worked with. He likes to eat healthy and acknowledges that Americans eat far too much meat and animal protein three times a day / seven days a week, so he was digging the vegan stuff I was showing him. Together, we created a vegan agnolotti and a vegan Caesar salad. For Caesar salad, to add the briny flavor you need, I use capers instead of anchovies—and people love it.”

“Use the whole carrot. Put the greens in salad, or cook them with some risotto—they are very good for you.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Carrots and cumin are great together.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“We juice carrots to use for stocks or other dishes, and then dehydrate the pulp. We confit carrots in oil, herbs, and spices to get that nice, fatty, succulent confit texture out of a carrot. We will fry some carrots into chips and pulse them into crumbs. We might pickle some carrots or ferment them, then dehydrate them and grind them into a powder to use as a seasoning. So we have now taken a carrot eight ways and give you those components back on one dish or throughout the four courses that you have during the course of a meal here. You have now gotten this whole depth of flavor from this carrot. If we do that with anywhere from two to eight components on a menu, all of a sudden you and your palate have been elevated to a whole different level. I equate it to an Old World wine compared to a New World wine: it is still red wine, but it is completely different.”

“The texture of cashews is so incredibly creamy, and works well in everything from appetizers to cashew cheese to entrees to desserts, which I’ll even top with a whipped cashew cream. Most live raw cheesecakes—which can range from German chocolate to key lime in flavor—are cashew-based, and they’re delicious.”

CAULIFLOWER


Season: autumn–winter



Flavor: sweet, with pungent notes of butter, mustard, nuts, and/or pepper, and a soft yet crunchy (when raw) / creamy (when cooked) texture



Volume: moderate



Nutritional profile: 64% carbs / 20% protein / 16% fat



Calories: 15 per ½-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: Better served cooked than raw. Bake, blanch, boil, braise, deep-fry, dry, fry, juice, mash, pressure-cook (2–3 minutes), puree, roast (20–25 minutes at 400°F), sauté, simmer, smoke, steam (5–10 minutes), stir-fry (2–5 minutes); however, overcooking highlights sulphur notes.



Tips: Do not overcook. Add pureed cauliflower to vegetable soups to give a creamy texture. Or slice thickly (¾ inch) into “steaks” and sauté to brown.

“I love chard! I love cooking the stems of rainbow chard, which have so much flavor. Just slice them and toss them in hot olive oil for one or two minutes, then add the greens, some garlic, some water or stock, and salt and pepper, and let them cook another two or three minutes. You can finish them with almonds, pine nuts, or pumpkin seeds for a little texture—and a shake of chili pepper flakes if you want a little kick.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)



“What we do here is build flavors: For example, we will stew chard with onions, garlic, and other traditional stewing ingredients that are really tasty, and then dehydrate some of it and turn it into a powder that will get worked into a gnocchi or pasta dough. It is a seasoning component that you would use about 5 percent in the dough. Next, you take the chard you didn’t dehydrate and put that in the dish with the gnocchi on top. We will also fry some chard as a garnish. All of the sudden, the chard takes on a whole level of flavor because we have incorporated it into different forms within the dish. So when people eat it, they say, ‘Wow—I have never tasted chard like this!’ This happens because we did not simply sauté some chard; we manipulated it, thought it through, and gave it back to you on a dish in a whole multitude of ways.”

Say (Vegan) Cheese!


Many vegans enjoy Daiya or Follow Your Heart brand vegan cheeses, which come in various flavors (e.g., cheddar, mozzarella) and often melt and stretch much as dairy cheese does.

I have been more impressed with the flavor of the artisanal vegan cheeses I’ve tasted, such as those at Pure Food and Wine in Manhattan. Portobello in Portland, Oregon, serves an artisanal vegan cheese plate that showcases cheeses from cheese-makers across the country, including Field Roast, Seattle-based producer of Chao Cheese (herb-crusted, tofu-based cheeses), Door 86 (Nashville), Heidi Ho (Portland, OR), Kite Hill (Hayward, CA), Punk Rawk Labs (Minneapolis), and Treeline Treenut Cheese (Kingston, NY).

Interested in making your own? Check out Miyoko Schinner’s 2012 book Artisan Vegan Cheese, which is developing a cult following among vegan chefs and foodies.

“When cherries come in, I love to use them in savory dishes. I like to pair them with a creamy burrata, which is a nice textural contrast. I might use them in a gastrique to create a sweet and sour flavor to play off the creaminess of the cheese. Cherries are also great with grains like farro or freekeh with lots of lemon. I like cherries with sweeter herbs like chervil or parsley, and they are great with basil. Cherries pair well with nuts, but since they’re used with almonds so much, I will pair them with black walnuts.”

“I spent two years in Hong Kong and found what they were doing with vegetarian food was very inspiring. At the time there was nowhere [in North America] to eat vegetarian food unless you wanted ‘hippy and crunchy.’ But in Hong Kong, it was natural because people ate vegetarian once or more a week and it was not considered weird. The flavors they were able to coax from meatless ingredients were amazing.”

“I love fresh young coconut meat, even plain. But if you add avocado and lime, you can make a pudding to die for! And you can also take it savory by making a ‘beef jerky’ from dehydrated coconut blended with cayenne, liquid smoke, and raw agave or maple syrup—it’s incredible.”

“Corn is a religion where I grew up [in the New York Finger Lakes region]. We treat corn like the French treat their baguettes. You don’t eat the baguettes you bought in the morning for dinner! Likewise, you buy and serve corn as fresh as possible. Corn is all about timing because it loses fifty percent of its sweetness after harvest. Farmers pick corn three times a day: at seven in the morning, at noon, and at three. Seven a.m. is the best, but you have to eat it for lunch. You buy your three o’clock corn for dinner. I like it simple: corn, butter, and salt. My wife Isabel [Bogadtke] likes her corn with lime and cumin seeds.”

—CHRISTOPHER BATES, HOTEL FAUCHERE (MILFORD, PA)




“Corn is the one ingredient I work with best, and I get a non-GMO corn so it tastes great. I will focus in on it, and it will end up being the favorite of both our guests and our servers. I made a chilled corn soup that people loved: I cut the corn off the cob, made corn milk, made a stock out of corn cobs, sautéed the corn in a bunch of onion, thyme, and garlic, then added the corn milk and stock. I reduced it, pureed it all together, and added some half and half. I served the soup with shaved radishes and parsley. It’s great because it is a cold soup when it is hot out, with the peppery radishes cutting the richness of the soup and an accent of vegetal green parsley rounding out the flavor and bringing it all together.”

CORNMEAL and POLENTA (see also GRITS)


Flavor: sweet, with notes of butter and/or corn, and a creamy texture (when cooked)



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: grain, made of dried corn kernels, ground to fine (e.g., corn flour, cornstarch), medium, or coarse (e.g., grits, polenta) texture



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 8% fat / 6% protein



Calories: 220 per ½-cup serving (whole grain, yellow, uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, broil, fry, grill, sauté, simmer



Timing: Cook until tender according to instructions on the back of the package, as this can vary from 1 minute (instant or fine) to 20–45 minutes (coarse).



Ratio: 1:3 (firm cornmeal, e.g., to grill or sauté) to 1:5–6 (soft, creamy cornmeal or polenta)



Tips: Opt for organic cornmeal. Use blue cornmeal, which is higher in protein than regular cornmeal, when you wish to add a light blueish, purplish hue to foods. Serve creamy polenta as an alternative to mashed potatoes. Alternatively, let polenta cool in a sheet pan; then cut into slices and broil, grill, or sauté lightly, before serving with tomato sauce and/or marinated vegetables.



Brand: Finely ground de la Estancia Organic Polenta is not an instant product but cooks to tender in less than 1 minute!

“I like making hot cucumber soup at home: I’ll cook the cucumbers with onion and a little extra-virgin olive oil and then add cumin, coriander, and masala curry. If I want the soup bright green, I’ll not add any white wine, but if I want a dull green, I’ll add white wine. To finish the soup, I might add either yogurt or crème fraîche—or if I want to take it even farther, I’ll add some kefir.”

“Cumin is one of my favorite spices, and a great supporting flavor. Its earthy/nutty/smoky flavor is very strong and can easily kill a dish—so you never want to use enough so that it can be tasted. Instead, just sprinkle a little on so that people will ask, ‘What is that flavor?!’ ”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

DEHYDRATING



“We use our dehydrator for a variety of things, including our powders, which we use a lot of. For example, we will dehydrate celery and then turn it into a powder for celery cake. We also dehydrate yellow tomatoes for tomato powder. We’ll also use the dehydrator for creating leathers with tomatoes, beets, and pears, or for turning cauliflower into crunchy little bits. Anything you can do in a dehydrator, you can do in an oven—it is simply faster using the dehydrator. The reason I use one is that if you are dehydrating something in the oven, you can’t use your oven for anything else.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)

“Our number-one dessert is crumbles. They’re seasonal, but often apple- or pear-based with berries. We’ll sweeten them with agave or brown sugar and season with some citrus zest and a splash of gin. Our topping is simple: brown sugar, a gluten-free flour blend (such as chickpea, rice, tapioca, and sorghum flours), and margarine or palm shortening.”

“We use five or six different varieties of eggplant—including Japanese eggplant, which have thinner skin and more meat to them. We have eggplant from May to November, which is seven months of eggplant. To keep it new, we choose different countries for inspiration. For example, I did a pop-up dinner and made Chinese sweet-and-sour eggplant, cooking it with chiles, Chinese vinegar, garlic, dark soy sauce, and cilantro. Sautéing the eggplant with all these ingredients makes it soak up all the flavors.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love vegetables in dessert because it is fun—that is number one! This is where we have our most creative dishes. The vegetable will be the catalyst, but I don’t want you leaving with a vegetable flavor—I want your last bite to be a sweet, happy moment at the end of the meal that brings together everything you just ate. Eggplant is more fruit than vegetable because it has seeds. It’s also like tofu in that it doesn’t have much flavor but will soak up the flavors you put it with. Eggplant has a luscious texture. I don’t know why I got obsessed with making eggplant tiramisu, but for some reason I did. We mix eggplant with mascarpone and then put it between layers of rosemary ladyfingers and it is just perfect!

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“You can’t not get the Eggplant Braciole when you come to Vedge. The dish is thin layers of eggplant that have been poached in olive oil and that are then wrapped around a filling of eggplant and roasted crushed cauliflower, finished with a green salsa verde. It has a lot of fresh herbs, a good punch of salt, and cured black olive on top. It has so many strong flavors, but you still taste eggplant and cauliflower. These dishes transcend the season, which we thought was important to do.”

—RICH LANDAU AND KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





“I’m working on a new roasted and stuffed eggplant dish right now, and the secret is avoiding the monotony of texture. I’m sure the dish will have some pine nuts for crunch, and most likely also some bulgur for chewiness, accented by feta cheese, onions, and lemon zest.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)

Vegan Egg Substitutes


For breakfast, instead of scrambling eggs, “scramble” tofu (e.g., extra-firm) with herbs and/or vegetables. Firm tofu also replaces hard-boiled egg whites in vegan dishes (e.g., “egg salads”).


When baking, you can use Ener-G Egg Replacer, a potato starch–based product that can often replace eggs in the ratio of 1½ teaspoons Ener-G to 2 tablespoons water for each egg, or other commercial egg replacers. However, there are probably already egg replacers in your cupboard or refrigerator, as you’ll see below.


How to know which other substitute to use? First, determine whether its need is for binding (i.e., holding the mixture together, without the need to rise, e.g., casseroles, veggie burgers), leavening (i.e., by adding air bubbles to a batter or dough, as well-beaten eggs do, e.g., in baked goods such as breads, cakes, cupcakes, or muffins), or simply adding moisture.





Egg Substitutes, each equivalent to 1 egg (best use)


¼ cup applesauce (adding moisture, e.g., in brownies, cakes, cupcakes, quickbreads)

¼ cup avocado, mashed (binding)

1 teaspoon baking soda + 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (leavening and adding moisture)

½ mashed banana (adding moisture and/or binding, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)

¼ cup carbonated water (leavening)

1 tablespoon chia seed meal + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (adding moisture; for leavening, add ¼ teaspoon baking powder)

¼ cup full-fat coconut milk + 1 teaspoon baking powder (leavening, esp. in compatibly flavored dishes)

¼ cup dried fruit (e.g., apricot, prune) puree (adding moisture)

1 tablespoon ground flax seeds + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (binding; for leavening: add ¼ teaspoon baking powder, esp. in nut/seed-compatible dishes, e.g., whole-grain cookies, muffins, pancakes)

3 tablespoons nut butter, e.g., peanut (binding, e.g., grain-based veggie burgers)

¼ cup silken tofu, blended (adding moisture, esp. in heavier baked goods, e.g., brownies, carrot cakes)

¼ cup vegetable puree, e.g., beets, carrots, pumpkin (adding moisture)

¼ cup yogurt, dairy or nondairy (adding moisture, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)



“We don’t cook with eggs, so I use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with baking powder to make my cakes rise. I’ve used Ener-G Egg Replacer when baking cookies. It has also worked surprisingly well in ‘meringues’ and looks beautiful.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

FARRO (aka EMMER WHEAT)


[FAHR-oh]



Flavor: slightly sweet, with earthy notes of barley and/or nuts, and a chewy texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: whole grain; Note: farro is not the same as spelt, which is typically a very slow-cooking grain.



Gluten-free: no



Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 12% protein / 7% fat



Calories: 170 per ¼ cup (uncooked)



Protein: 7 grams



Timing: Presoak farro for fastest cooking. Although whole farro is available, most of the farro available in the U.S. is semipearled (semi-perlato or pearled (perlato), i.e., with some or all of the outside husk removed. Whole farro takes longest to cook (45–60 minutes or longer), while pearled farro can cook in as little as half that time. Simmer farro, covered, until tender.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup farro to 2–3 cups cooking liquid)



Tip: Add the cooking water from white cannellini beans to give a creamier, starchier texture to “farrotto.”

“Farro is my favorite grain because of its nuttiness. I like mixing it into green salads with dried apricots and radishes.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love farro’s nutty flavor and toothy texture, and the sensation of eating farrotto. Farro doesn’t give off starch the same way Arborio rice does, but it still has some of its own sauce like risotto.… You can make a different version each season: Spring calls for lots of peas, spring onions, spinach, and vegetable stock. Summer could be corn with tomatoes. Autumn farroto with butternut squash, kale, and roasted garlic could have Parmesan shaved on top. Winter farrotto could feature wild mushrooms and either vegetable stock or the soaking water from dried porcini.”

FENUGREEK


Flavor: bitter/sweet; aromatic, with pungent and/or savory notes of burnt sugar, caramel, celery, chocolate, coffee, and/or maple syrup



Volume: quiet/moderate (leaves)–moderate/loud (seeds)



What it is: used as an herb (dried or fresh leaves), a spice (seeds), and as a vegetable (fresh)



Tips: Toast fenugreek seeds to bring out their flavor, which resembles maple syrup. (Indeed, fenugreek is used in making artificial maple syrup.) Long cooking (e.g., simmering) will quiet their flavor. Sprouted fenugreek seeds can be used in salads.

Who says they’re healthful: Joel Fuhrman, in his “Top Super Foods for Super Immunity”



What’s healthful about them: 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds every day—such as on cereal or in a smoothie—fulfills daily omega-3 fatty acids needs.



Tips: Buy whole seeds and grind immediately before using. Seeds must be ground to release their full nutritional value. Do not cook on high heat if you want to maintain nutritional benefits. To use as an egg substitute when baking, use 1 heaping tablespoon to substitute for 1 large egg: soak flaxseeds in hot water in a 1:3 ratio before blending into a thick paste (1 tablespoon flaxseeds to 3 tablespoons water).

FLOUR, RICE



“I like to use rice flour—grinding in some Arborio rice for texture, and some sesame or coriander seeds for texture and flavor—as a crust for fried mushrooms. Just dip the mushrooms into soy milk, or rice milk with a little Dijon mustard added for viscosity, and then into the rice flour mixture before frying.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)





FLOUR, SPELT



“Because spelt flour doesn’t have as much gluten as wheat flour, muffins made with it don’t rise as high, so instead of filling muffin tins two-thirds full, we fill them three-quarters full.”

—MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX, AZ)




“We make apple cider doughnuts with spelt flour, which is very good for you, with lots of vitamins and easy to digest. We tried making the doughnut with whole-grain wheat flour, but it was very heavy. To sweeten the doughnut as well as other cakes, I use maple syrup, which is not overpowering. In 2010, Time Out awarded us ‘best doughnut,’ and the funny thing is my partner owns a Dunkin’ Donuts.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“I think spelt flour pizza has more flavor than white flour pizza. It’s really good served with pears and ricotta.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)





FLOUR, SPROUTED


Brands: Essential Eating, To Your Health





Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company


As a chef, my interest is in whole-plant cooking—from root to fruit—as integral to a more healthful and enjoyable way of living. But food has to first satisfy taste, so the challenge is always to find the right combination of ingredients and balance of flavors and textures. I have been experimenting with grains and beans in nontraditional ways: folded into muffins, added to savory custards, and pulverized into tart crusts. This also allows me to bring energy-rich plant foods into our products replacing white flours and sugars, which are devoid of nutrition. Sprouted-grain flours are especially interesting to me because they offer not only great flavor, but also an energy-rich ingredient for baked goods.

Because my kitchen is focused on developing savory baked items, I try to create the flavors first and then select how they are best presented.

Here are some combos:





Savory:


sprouted spelt flour muffin with asparagus, sorrel, pumpkin seed, and parmesan

sprouted corn flour muffin with pickled beet, macadamia nut, and goat cheese

millet flour biscuit with roasted chickpeas, sumac, and sesame seed

savory rice pudding with confit of fennel, carrot, and tarragon

quinoa pudding with broccoli and cheddar





Fruit:


coconut flour scone with wild blueberries, ginger root, and hempseed

wild rice and quinoa muffin with bananas, dried cranberries, and walnuts

chocolate cherry scone with vanilla bean kefir and almonds

strawberry jam muffin with pomegranate molasses, Meyer lemon, and chia seed





FLOWERS, EDIBLE


While several varieties of flowers are edible—such as (sweet licorice) anise hyssop, (cucumber-like, sweet honey-like) borage, carnations, chicory, (garlicy, oniony) chives, chrysanthemums, daisies, day lilies, (herbal, pungent, sweet) lavender, (bitter, floral, sour) marigolds, (honey, peppery) nasturtiums, (minty) pansies, and (sweet) violets—most do not add much flavor of their own. Rather, they’re mostly decorative.





“We grow edible flowers on our roof at Mélisse.… Pollen is what gives most edible flowers their sweet, individual flavors.… Nasturtiums are stronger flavored than most edible flowers—they have a very strong, floral, peppery, spicy flavor. Yellow wood sorrel is also strongly sour.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)





FREEKEH (aka FRIKEH)


[FREE-kah]



Flavor: earthy notes of grass, meat, nuts, and/or smoke, with a chewy texture



Volume: moderate



What it is: young green wheat that has been set on fire before harvesting; i.e., grain



Techniques: simmer (20–30 minutes)



Ratio: 1: 1½–2 (1 cup freekeh to 1½–2 cups cooking liquid)



Tip: To bring out its nuttiness, toast in a pan before cooking.



Possible substitute: bulgur + drops of liquid smoke

“When I was twenty-six, I went to France for the first time. My takeaway was that the French love vegetables! It was simple food with a tremendous impact. I also learned that they love to use pressure cookers to cook their vegetables. It makes the vegetables turn into a soft state, sort of a melting texture. The aromas from this technique are like nothing else.… During my time in France, it felt like every meal had a tart! Or if Americans are thought to always be eating hot dogs and hamburgers, I felt the same could be said about the French and their tarts. In France, lunch is the big meal of the day, so dinner is often lighter—such as a zucchini tart with custard and curry spices, served with a salad. I learned from a French woman to make my tart dough with half-butter, half-margarine, which made a crisper tart shell, but now I use 100 percent Earth Balance for our vegan tart.”

“Ginger might not have been a part of traditional Shojin [Buddhist monk] cuisine, but I can’t imagine not using it—I can’t be restrained by the old rules, which also prohibited tea and alcohol. Ginger is a magical ingredient with extraordinary flavor and textures that goes well with almost everything, and it has healing properties that can quickly and inexpensively heal my wife’s winter colds.… One of my secrets when making pickled ginger is instead of cooling the ginger in the boiling pickling liquid in the fridge, I’ll drain it and cool it with a fan, which concentrates its flavor.”

GRAINS, FAST-COOKING (see COUSCOUS and QUINOA)





[WHOLE] GRAINS AND CEREALS (see also COUSCOUS, WHOLE-WHEAT; POLENTA; QUINOA; RICE, BROWN; WHEAT BERRIES, etc.)


Tips: It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of grains you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, there are some general rules of thumb that may be helpful: Rinse grains before cooking. Combine grain with the cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid in the ratio indicated for the specific grain. Bring to a boil, add the grain, and bring to a boil again. Then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for the cooking time indicated. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved; then remove from heat and leave covered for 5–15 minutes before fluffing with a fork and serving.

“You can’t overcook grains like barley or farro. Cooking farro risotto style as farrotto is common in Italy, and I’ll cook barley the same way, so that it’s chewy and toothy. But bulgur can overcook and turn mushy, so you really have to keep an eye on it. Grains are also great to dehydrate and powder for crusts… or to dry [dehydrate] and fry, to turn into ‘Rice Krispies.’ ”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“The secret is not to serve too large a portion of grains on a plate or people will get bored with them. I like to season grains with dried fruits, such as apricots, currants, figs, or apples and pears in the winter. Or I’ll season them with powders and ashes [made from dehydrated vegetables]. Or I’ll fill things like cabbage, chard, or kale with grains, and roll them up dolma-style—such as quinoa and dehydrated kimchi powder wrapped up in a cabbage leaf with dried figs or currants and pickled peppers or cucumbers. The overall impact it makes takes your brain on a ride.”

“There are two ends of the cooking spectrum you want to concentrate on—one is high heat and the other is low heat. On high heat you want to cook your vegetable higher and faster than you normally would to get that sear and caramelization and let it stay crunchy on the inside so you have a textural contrast. Or go low and slow; that way you get a crispy outside and a dehydrated chew on the inside. Home cooks know how to do this with meat; they just need to do it with vegetables. A good example of a high-heat, fast-cooking dish we do now is the Chinese green choy sum. It gets a nice crispiness, it is barely cooked, and it gets tossed in a bowl and wilts on itself. If we cook the choy sum really low, it turns into a flat, dehydrated, crispy green.”

“After cutting the spiny part out of the collard greens, soak them in lemon juice to soften them, and wrap them around ingredients for a breadless ‘sandwich,’ or use them instead of nori to make vegetarian maki rolls. Use a mandoline to slice vegetables to tuck inside.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“When collard greens are cooked right, they have a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I like to cook them with a little olive oil, sliced garlic, a splash of water, and a pinch of salt, and to serve them as a side dish to Creole-style tempeh with mashed potatoes.”

“I grill almost every vegetable—radishes, kohlrabi, cabbage. Even spinach, kale, and chard—I’ll put some olive oil and salt on them, pile them up, and grill them on high heat, flipping them twice. Grilled beets are great, although I’ll parcook them for about five minutes first, so they’re a little soft—and you can cook parsnips and radishes the same way.”

HERBS, DRIED


Volume: typically louder than their fresh versions, so adjust accordingly



Tip: Use dried herbs early in the cooking process, as they need time to reconstitute and release their flavor.





HIZIKI (aka HIJIKI)


[hee-ZEE-kee; hee-JEE-kee]



Flavor: salty, with notes of the earth and/or sea, and a delicate yet firm texture



Volume: moderate–loud



What it is: sea vegetable, with the appearance of dried black threads



Calories: 5 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: sauté, simmer (about 30–40 minutes)



Tips: Its grittiness requires it to be soaked (twice) in cold water for 10 minutes each time before use (discarding the gritty soaking water). Soaking will also tame its saltiness. Also, hiziki will expand fourfold, taking on the appearance of black angel hair pasta.

JACKFRUIT, UNRIPE GREEN


Season: summer



Flavor: neutral, with faint notes of apple, banana, lychee, mango, melon (e.g., cantaloupe), and/or pineapple; and the chewy, flaky, juicy, or meaty texture of dry pineapple, shredded chicken, or pulled pork



Volume: quiet



What it is: tropical fruit



Nutritional profile: 92% carbs / 5% protein / 3% fat



Calories: 155 per 1-cup serving (sliced, raw)



Protein: 2 grams



Technique: marinate



Tips: Look in Asian or Indian markets for unripe (aka green or young) jackfruit in cans (packed in brine, not sweet syrup!) or frozen (packed in brine). Chef Susan Feniger prefers using shredded and cooked jackfruit to processed faux meats in Street’s vegan dishes such as baos and tacos. She has found that jackfruit takes on whatever flavors it’s cooked with and even fools meat eaters. You’ll typically want to rinse, drain, and shred before using; alternatively, cut into bite-sized triangles, as you would pineapple. Jackfruit is the world’s largest tree fruit and can grow up to three feet long. Keep an eye out for products from Annie Ryu’s Global Village Fruits.

JUICES (see also SMOOTHIES)


Technique Tips: We love our Champion juicer (as do many of the other experts interviewed for this book) and know others who are happy with their Omega juicers. Diane Forley of Flourish makes juice in her Vitamix, adding a little water and then straining the juice through a nut milk bag—and finds the cleanup even easier than with a juicer.

Flavor Tips: Avoid mixing kale with romaine, which ends up “tasting like mud,” according to NYC’s Blossom owner Pamela Elizabeth. To add a sweet note, mix green juices with agave nectar, beets, coconut water, dates, fruit, honey, or maple syrup.





“My favorite green juice is made from apples, celery, collard greens, kale, and lemon.”

—DIANE FORLEY, FLOURISH (SCARSDALE, NEW YORK)




“My default morning juice is one made from cilantro, fennel, ginger, kale, lemon, pears, and pineapple.”

—MATTHEW KENNEY, M.A.K.E. (SANTA MONICA)




“A dash of lemon juice is the best way to cut the ‘fresh-mown grass’ flavor of some of the stronger green juices. Even better is adding lemon juice, apple juice, and ginger.”

—MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)

Tips: Opt for organic kale. Many kale aficionados prefer the variety known as black kale (aka dinosaur kale or Tuscan kale), for its greater flavor complexity and silky texture. Macerate (and marinate) raw kale in Dijon mustard to flavor it and soften its texture.

“Kale isn’t a summer crop, but there’s so much demand for it that it’s served year-round. In the summer, the hot sun can make it more bitter and tougher, so it’s less of a salad green and more of a braising green, requiring longer cooking to soften it.”

—PAM BROWN, GARDEN CAFÉ (WOODSTOCK, NY)




“If I’m making a kale salad, I’ll massage the kale with oil and maybe Dijon mustard. I want a combination of acid, oil, and salt.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“I love serving charred kale with smoked tofu, which I’ll mince like bacon bits and let provide the same kind of smoky accent.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I love kale—and was an early adapter. I’ve only eaten it raw over the past couple of years. Before that, I preferred it braised, or sautéed with garlic and olive oil, or added to pasta along with feta cheese and pine nuts.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR OF THE MOOSEWOOD COOKBOOK AND THE HEART OF THE PLATE




“We go through crates and crates of kale every week, and always prefer the less bitter, more refined blue-green Tuscan kale over regular kale, which is much tougher. With either kale, we’ll marinate it in garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to soften it.”

—CASSIE AND MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)

LEGUMES (see also specific BEANS, CHICKPEAS, LENTILS, PEANUTS, PEAS, and SOYBEANS)


Tip: Many chefs are experimenting with smoking legumes to enhance their “meatiness.”





Cooking Legumes


There are three major categories of legumes:

pulses, including chickpeas, lentils, dried beans, dried peas

fresh beans and fresh peas

peanuts and soybeans



It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of legumes you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, here are some helpful rules of thumb:

Rinse legumes to remove any dirt or foreign objects (e.g., tiny pebbles).

Soak most legumes overnight in water before cooking. This shortens their cooking time and increases their digestibility. Discard the soaking water. (If time is of the essence, legumes can still benefit from a quick soak achieved by bringing them to a boil in water, then removing from heat, and letting them stand for at least an hour. Drain and rinse before proceeding.)

Combine legumes with cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, partially covering the pot, and simmer. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved, and then remove from heat.





LEMONGRASS


Flavor: sour/sweet, with notes of citrus (e.g., lemon or lemon zest) and/or flowers



Volume: quiet–moderate/loud



What it is: Southeast Asian grass used as a flavoring



Techniques: puree, simmer



Tips: Use fresh. Remove whole stalks after cooking and before serving. Otherwise, puree or slice these fibrous stalks very, very thinly.



Possible substitute: lemon zest

“I learned how to make black lentils when I cooked for two years at Bucara in Delhi, which is one of the best Indian restaurants in the world. After soaking them overnight and draining them, we would slow-boil them over low heat for two hours before seasoning them with ginger, garlic paste, tomato puree, salt, chili powder, unsalted butter, and heavy cream. They were so rich and delicious that we’d make 50 or 60 pounds of them every day to serve 300 guests! I still make them the same way today.”

“Red lentils are my favorite lentils. I love their flavor, which is both lentil-y and unique at the same time. And I love how they break down to reach such a creamy texture. I like to cook them Egyptian-style with potatoes, then puree them, seasoning them with cumin, salt, and pepper before finishing them with a squeeze of lemon.”

MEDITERRANEAN CUISINES (see GREEK CUISINE, ITALIAN CUISINE—SOUTHERN, etc.)



“So much Mediterranean food is inherently vegan, which is why we refer to Crossroads as a Mediterranean restaurant. We don’t use the word ‘vegan’ here. This way, the food is not seen as foreign to people who eat here. At Crossroads, people are not eating tofu or tempeh or seitan, whose textures are foreign to most people. While I like tempeh, you are not going to convince someone to go vegan if that is the first thing they try. People need familiar food that is transitional, and that will depend on the person. Our spanakopita or spiced chickpeas are dishes people are already acquainted with, and our risotto is the least threatening dish on the menu and something that people have already had.”

Make Your Own Almond Milk


Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company says it’s easy to make your own delicious almond milk by

soaking raw almonds overnight

draining them

combining soaked almonds with fresh water in a 1:3 ratio in a Vitamix

straining the milk through a fine-mesh nut milk bag

adding cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)



You can also cook down almond milk, adding a pinch of pectin, then chill, to create a yogurt-like almond cream to enjoy on its own or with berries, granola, etc.

“We make our own coconut milk–based ice creams and use Irish moss to stabilize them. We’ll even top them with ‘whipped cream’ from a siphon, which is also coconut milk-based. Coconut Bliss is a fantastic Oregon-based dairy-free ‘ice cream’ made with coconut milk and agave, which was recently sold to a dairy.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)




“We have a new vegan truck for selling burgers, and desserts like our Vegan Fat Boys, which are vegan brownies filled with coconut milk–based Coconut Bliss ice cream. The texture is very rich and creamy, not icy, and its flavor is not overpowering.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“We make our ice cream from a blend of coconut milk and soy milk, which prevents the flavor, texture, and color of either milk from interfering with that of the ice cream. The result is a very thick and creamy ice cream.… Our roast pumpkin ice cream is accented mostly by cinnamon, but also allspice, cloves, and nutmeg.… Coconut milk has such a high fat content that all you need to do is add a bit of powdered sugar and run it through a charged canister to have nice, thick whipped cream.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)




“Our signature ice cream starts with coconut cream, organic unrefined cane sugar, agave, and a trace amount of plant-based stabilizers (guar and xanthan gum), and works well with exotic spicy and savory flavors, such as toasted pine nut and fennel, or Mexican chocolate with cayenne and cinnamon, or Thai chili peanut. Our nut-based flavors are made with an almond and cashew blend, and work best with more traditional flavors like caramel, chocolate, cookie, peanut butter, and vanilla. Our soft ice cream flavors are made with a soy base.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)




“Coconut milk is fantastic—it’s saved our lives in being able to serve our vegan guests. We use it a lot in vegan desserts, like our coconut milk panna cotta. The mouthfeel is not the same as when making a dairy panna cotta, so you’ve got to use a bit more vanilla and sugar. And we’ve made mousses by putting a mixture of coconut milk and agar-agar through an iSi whipped cream dispenser.”

—MARK LEVY, THE POINT (SARANAC LAKE, NY)





MILK, GOAT


Flavor: salty/sour/ sweet



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Can be easier to digest given its lower level of lactose (4.1%) than cow’s milk (4.7%) and the absence of cow’s milk’s main problem-causing protein (alpha SI casein). Sweeten and reduce over medium heat to make cajeta (a thick Mexican caramel sauce).

“We tested lots of different nondairy milks to come up with our recipe for a latte with the creamy richness of cow’s milk, which is half hemp milk and half coconut milk, plus agave nectar as a sweetener, added to two shots of espresso. Either will be good on its own, but the fat from the coconut milk adds great richness, while the hemp milk adds a more understated nutty flavor, and together they foam up really well.”

“When I opened Verbena [in 1994], I would go to Kalustyan’s [the famed Manhattan spice and specialty food store] and buy unusual grains to serve. Millet was never used at other restaurants at the time. In Verbena’s review in The New York Times, it was referred to as ‘bird seed.’ So you see how much times have changed!”

What it is: Japanese fermented soybean paste, available in countless different varieties in Japan—as many varieties as there are types of cheese available in the U.S.!



Nutritional profile: 55% carbs / 25% fat / 20% protein



Calories: 275 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 16 grams



Techniques: To protect miso’s nutritional value, never bring to a boil.



Tips: Mix light and dark misos for more complex flavors. Add miso to mashed or pureed vegetables and use as a sauce. Also, customize miso soup by the season; for example, in spring/summer, use light miso + basil + green beans, and in autumn/winter, use dark miso + Brussels sprouts + garlic.

“If green vegetables are the king of Super Immunity, mushrooms are the queen.… White, cremini, portobello, oyster, maitake, and reishi mushrooms have all been shown to have anticancer effects.”

—DR. JOEL FUHRMAN, IN SUPER IMMUNITY




“Bottom line, mushrooms are good medicine. Cook them well before eating them and enjoy a variety rather than any one specific type.”

—DR. ANDREW WEIL, ON DRWEIL.COM




“Raw mushrooms are technically not supposed to be good for you. Also, the texture you get from them when they are cooked is much more exciting than when they are raw. So how do you give your mushrooms flavor without heat [as in raw cuisine]? You do it with citrus and salt because they will bring out a lot of flavor and enhance its texture. If you rub a mushroom with salt, the water comes out and the solids collapse and it becomes soft.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Abalone mushrooms, which are available in August and again in February through April in the Pacific Northwest, are incredibly meaty, meaty mushrooms. They’re giant, about five inches in diameter. I’ll slice them thick, score them, and poach them for an hour in butter, cognac, shallot, garlic, parsley, and thyme until they’re soft, and serve them with candied pistachios.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“I love trumpet mushrooms, which are milder in flavor and have the texture of scallops. They take marinades really well.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I’ll slice large Trumpet Royale mushrooms into scallops, whose great texture they resemble, although they’re not as yielding or buttery. They can be woody, so I’ll acidulate them with lemon juice, which makes them tender and lovely, and their residual sugar helps with their caramelization when I sauté them in garlic and olive oil.”

“We’ve been making our Hen of the Woods mushroom pâté for years now, and it tastes like wild, foraged maitakes. We sear them in olive oil with caramelized onions, shallots, garlic, thyme, mushroom stock, and port (like traditional pâté), and finish them with mascarpone and truffle oil. We use agar-agar to make a port gelée.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“We serve a roasted maitake mushroom with celery root fritter and grilled leek rémoulade. We love the texture of the mushroom because it is a wedge, so you get the singed, frilly little edge of the mushroom along with the juicy succulent base.”

“There is nothing on the planet like matsutake mushrooms! You’ve got to treat them delicately. I’ve served them with housemade buckwheat noodles, or simply grilled over rice.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)




“There may be no more prized ingredient in Japanese cuisine than matsutake mushrooms. They are as celebrated in Japan as truffles are in Italy or France. I love the texture of the mushroom, and will never forget a shockingly good version of a sukiyaki dish I tasted that featured them. But that dish was like a short-distance dash—and I like serving them cooked in a pot as a dobin mushi, which really celebrates their lasting flavor and is more like a long-distance marathon.”

“The inspiration for my artichoke oysters dish [which is served with artichoke puree, crispy oyster mushrooms, yellow tomato béarnaise, and kelp caviar] came from peeling an artichoke one day. I was peeling the leaves and one fell on a plate on its back and it looked like an oyster shell. One of the things I love to do is re-create dishes I love that I miss being a vegan and dishes that are unexpected in a vegan diet. The inspiration was nature, and it turned into ‘oysters Rockefeller.’ ”

Chef Colin Bedford of North Carolina’s Fearrington House on Mushrooms


At the Fearrington House, we treat mushrooms very much like meat. We will take larger king oyster or maitake mushrooms and confit them whole in olive oil, or we will sous-vide them as that is another great technique to infuse flavor and to create layers of flavors. The flavors differ throughout the year. In March, we use thyme, garlic, and white wine, as the wine really brightens the flavor.

King Oysters are nice, big, fat mushrooms. We will confit them with garlic, bay leaf, and thyme. The ratio of stalk to cap is crazy—like 5 percent cap to 95 percent stalk, so we use the stalk for carpaccio, cooking the mushrooms at 85°C for one to one-and-a-half hours with lots of aromatics. Once they are cool, we slice them thin on a mandoline and lay them on the plate. With the dish, we add crosnes, which are like a really cool artichoke; sunchokes, roasted cippolini onions, and garlic chips for a crispy texture.

Maitake mushrooms are my favorite. They have a meaty quality and are so versatile. We will confit them whole. Sunchokes work really well with them, as does ginger, which gives it a warm, earthy tone—with fresh ginger adding heat, and candied ginger mellowing the flavor. I’ll also use sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup—we use Mikuni Wild Harvest’s NOBLE maple syrup.

Chanterelles are another favorite. Thyme is one of my favorite pairings, as is sage; I will use one or the other. In the fall or winter, black garlic also works well with them: We will caramelize and puree the garlic, which has a kind of fermented quality that brings up sweetness, and from there we will add some Madeira and maple [syrup] for more flavor. Chanterelles are a mushroom that we don’t cook to order. We like to cook them beforehand and stew them down with aromatics, butter, and just a pinch of white wine at the end to balance the flavors.

Matsutakes call for keeping it simple, so we don’t mess around with them too much, and simply confit them. After they are cooked, we will score and then pan sear them so you get that contrasting texture.

Doubloons are smaller than shiitake mushrooms, but we treat them the same way.





Pickling Mushrooms with Colin Bedford


Beech mushrooms are perfect for pickling, as they are essentially sponges. A cremini would be too hard; you would just get little nuggets. When pickling mushrooms, the pickling solution will depend on the season, which will influence our choice of vinegar—for example:

• Autumn: madeira and sherry vinegars

• Winter: port wine, red wine, and raspberry vinegars

• Spring: lemon and chardonnay vinegars

• Summer: white balsamic and champagne vinegars





MUSTARD, e.g., DIJON (see also GREENS, MUSTARD; MUSTARD POWDER; MUSTARD SEEDS)


Flavor: bitter; hot, with peppery, spicy notes



Volume: moderate–very loud



Tips: For most purposes, choose Dijon mustard (made with verjus instead of vinegar); other options include stone-ground and/or whole-grain mustard. Add mustard at the end of the cooking process.

“During a kaiseki menu, you want to make a certain impact with the very first course, and to make sure the main course itself is outstanding.

NORI (aka LAVER)


[NOR-ee]



Flavor: salty, with notes of the sea, and the texture of handmade paper



Volume: quiet (as is)–moderate (after toasting)



What it is: dried and pressed sheets of seaweed, typically used to wrap sushi, hand rolls, and nori (aka maki) rolls



What’s healthful about it: easy to digest; higher in protein than any other seaweed



Nutritional profile: 53% carbs / 40% protein / 7% fats



Calories: 1 calorie per sheet



Tips: Lightly toast the dried seaweed sheet before using, by waving it over an open flame on your stovetop, which enhances its flavor and texture. At traditional sushi restaurants, vegetarian options typically include white or brown short-grain sticky rice rolls filled with avocado and/or cucumber. However, New York City’s Beyond Sushi features iron-rich six-grain rice—a delicious medley of rye berries, barley, pearl barley, brown rice, red rice, and black rice.

“When I visited France, I noticed that every house I visited smelled of nutmeg! I use fresh whole nutmeg in my potatoes Dauphinois. I will also add nutmeg to the yam I make with cinnamon, bay leaf, thyme, and few other ingredients. I will also add it to potatoes, cream, garlic, and thyme. It even works with sautéed spinach and greens as balance to the bitterness.”

—KEN LARSEN, TABLE VERTE (NEW YORK CITY)

OATMEAL and OATS


Flavor: slightly sweet, with notes of nuts, and a chewy and/or creamy texture (when cooked)



Volume: quiet



What it is: whole grain



Nutritional profile: 70% carbs / 15% protein / 15% fats



Calories: 110 per 1-ounce serving (uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer



Timing: Cook Scottish oats about 10 minutes, or old-fashioned (aka rolled) oats about 10–15 minutes, covered; steel-cut oats will cook in about 30 minutes, although cooking time can be cut by presoaking.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup oats to 2–3 cups liquid, e.g., almond milk or water)



Tips: To make a creamier oatmeal, use Scottish oats and/or substitute milk (e.g., almond) for some or all of the water. For chewier oatmeal, opt for steel-cut oats. In-between? You might prefer good old-fashioned rolled oats. Whole oat groats can be used in savory dishes, such as pilafs.

OIL—IN GENERAL


Virtually all oils have about 120 calories per 1-tablespoon serving, and are high in fats and low in nutrients.



Tips: Select an oil based on its intended purpose, e.g., finishing dishes (e.g., extra-virgin olive, flavored), or low-, medium-, or high-temperature (e.g., grapeseed, peanut, safflower) cooking. Always opt for unrefined and less processed oils (e.g., “expeller-pressed” or “cold pressed”), which are free of chemicals and solvents, and choose organic corn and soybean oils.

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, CANOLA


Flavor: neutral



Volume: quiet



What it is: rapeseed oil from CANada (which is where it gets its name)



Techniques: bake, fry, sauté



Tips: Use only organic, expeller-pressed canola oil, as many canola oils are made from GMO seeds; otherwise, opt for another oil altogether. Use as fresh as possible, and check regularly for rancidity (as it goes rancid quickly). Canola oil can be used for medium- (e.g., baking) to high-temperature (e.g., frying) cooking. Use with boldly flavored dishes that would obscure the flavor of more expensive oils.

“I’ll blend coconut oil with cacao powder to make raw truffles, while I use coconut butter in raw desserts.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“The choice of oil in baking is important. For cookies I will use canola, grapeseed, or coconut oil. The coconut oil is used in our doughnuts and cakes as well, but you have to be careful so that the flavor does not become overpowering.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Coconut oil is a liquid when it’s at 72°F and up, and a solid with the texture of butter or shortening at temperatures below 72°F. When we make biscuits, we’ll use solid coconut oil and cut it into the dough, which results in a layering effect and flakier biscuits. We’ll also cut solid coconut oil into our pancake batter, where it has a leavening effect that makes our pancakes light and fluffy—more so than with canola oil.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)





OIL, FLAXSEED


What’s healthful about it: omega-3 fatty acids



Tips: Flaxseeds are said to be even higher in lignans than flaxseed oil is. Heating flaxseed oil destroys its nutrients. Store in the refrigerator.

“The flavor of olive oil can sometimes be overpowering, so I will often use grapeseed oil—which has a nice, neutral flavor—in a ratio of two parts grapeseed oil to one part olive oil.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, HAZELNUT


Flavor: notes of hazelnuts



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Use for low- to medium-temperature cooking (e.g., baking, sautéing), or as a finishing oil. Use caution when cooking, as hazelnut oil burns easily. Store in the refrigerator, and use within a few months after opening.

OIL, NUT (see OIL, ALMOND; OIL, HAZELNUT; OIL, PISTACHIO; OIL, WALNUT)





OIL, OLIVE


Flavor: earthy notes of fruit and/or olives, with a rich texture



Volume: quieter (e.g., lighter-colored virgin)–louder (e.g., deeper-colored extra-virgin)



Techniques: bake, fry, raw, sauté (on low heat)



Tips: Use raw, or warm only to low temperatures. Opt for lighter, quieter virgin (aka “pure”) oil for baking, frying, grilling, roasting, and sautéing, and darker, louder extra-virgin oil for dressing salads or drizzling on bruschetta or pizza. For salad dressings, the typical ratio is one part vinegar to three or four parts extra-virgin olive oil, but those looking to lower the fat in their diets (not to mention calories) should consider using less oil.

“I can sum up in two words the difference between vegetarian cooking in the 1970s vs. today: olive oil. Back then, it was common to mask dishes with the richness of butter and cream. Olive oil lets more of the flavor shine through, particularly dishes made with garlic and herbs.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR




“One you’ve fallen in love with the flavor of extra-virgin olive oil, there’s no place to go after that. I’ll only use it to finish dishes. For high-heat cooking, I use canola, grapeseed, or safflower oil—or some combination thereof.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





OIL, PEANUT


Flavor: neutral (regular)–nutty (roasted)



Volume: quiet (regular)–moderate/loud (roasted)

Tips: Use for medium-(e.g., baking, sautéing) to high-temperature cooking (e.g., frying, stir-frying). Use sparingly, if at all, as sunflower seed oil is often highly refined and processed, as well as high in unhealthful omega-6 fatty acids. If you do use it, look for the high-oleic version and/or Loriva brand.

ORGANIC PRODUCE


Tip: Opt for organic produce whenever possible—and definitely when you buy one of the Environmental Working Group (EWG)’s so-called “Dirty Dozen Plus” fruits or vegetables, which are those most affected by chemical contamination, i.e., apples, bell peppers, celery, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers, collard greens, cucumbers, grapes, kale, nectarines (imported), peaches, potatoes, spinach, strawberries, and summer squash.



The EWG notes that “[t]he health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure. Use EWG’s Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides™ to reduce your exposures as much as possible, but eating conventionally-grown produce is far better than not eating fruits and vegetables at all.”

“I love parsley as a flavor. Parsley risotto is amazing, and its color is as vibrant as its flavor. There is more to parsley than just the leaf; I use the stems and roots as well. The stems add good texture, and I use them to add crunch to soups. As for the root, which has an herbaceousness similar to parsnips, I like to roast and puree them for soups as well.… People also need to remember that there is more than flat-leaf parsley out there. I am a fan of curly parsley, which is often overlooked and has an intense, almost celery-like flavor. There was a time in America when you couldn’t serve a plate without the orange wedge and curly parsley.”

“If I’m serving a smooth pureed parsnip soup, I’ll layer other parsnip flavors into the dish—for example, both cooked and raw parsnips, fried parsnip chips, and a confited parsnip ‘butter.’ I’ll keep working to think of new ways to get more parsnip flavor into the dish one more time—like taking the parsnip oil from confited parsnips and reemulsifying it back into the soup. All together, the flavor becomes so much more impactful.”

“There are entire regions of Italy that make pasta without eggs. Gnocchi is made without eggs in Liguria [so it’s naturally vegan]. I don’t use eggs in my ravioli dough—I use tapioca flour. I sometimes stuff ravioli with thick cashew cream, or kale, or a vegetable puree. I’ve served English pea ravioli with morels, mint, lemon zest, and sweated shallots.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)

Talking with Chef Chris Eddy of Winvian about Cooking for Vegetarians


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was a simple vegetarian pappardelle dish I was served at Winvian, a unique Connecticut resort that houses eighteen individually designed cottages, including a helicopter and a treehouse. It featured a green sauce, along with sautéed cauliflower, mushrooms, and onions, and a very light dusting of grated cheese on top. The creamy sauce turned out to be a steamed broccoli puree made in a Vitamix with a bit of ice (“to cool the broccoli as quickly as possible,” according to chef Chris Eddy), some clear vegetable stock (“so as not to interfere with the beautiful green color”), a hint of heat in the form of either cayenne or chili pepper flakes (“always—it’s a ‘calling card’ that leaves an impression even after you’ve finished eating”), and just a touch of brown butter (“to add an amazing dimension to the sauce”). It’s based on a “ridiculously simple” technique Eddy learned while working with Chef Alain Ducasse and, I can attest, it’s ridiculously delicious.

Eddy says the technique works just as well with other vegetables—whether cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, or parsnips—and if added richness is desired, one could substitute cream for some of the clear vegetable stock (“although its whiteness fades the bright colors”), though the dish is creamy and rich even without added cream.

While Eddy characterizes Winvian’s customers as about 35 to 40 percent pescetarian, he and chef de cuisine Patrick Espinoza and their kitchen team spent a month eating vegetarian during the summer of 2013, just for the experience of putting themselves into the shoes of the significant portion of Winvian’s clientele (“about 7 or 8 percent of our customers”) who eat vegetarian. Why? “Number one, we love vegetables,” Eddy admits. But out of compassion for Winvian’s vegetarian customers, “We wanted to ‘feel their pain.’ We came to understand their frustration [at other restaurants] of only being offered the same dishes again and again—whether eggplant Parmesan, or risotto, or a salad—when they went out to dine.” In addition to prompting Eddy and his team to come up with an ever-changing array of dishes like the incredible pappardelle I fell in love with, their month-long vegetarian experiment had an added bonus: a number of Eddy’s cooks discovered that they felt healthier and sometimes less irritable.

“Now, we like to go all out for our vegetarian guests, and give them something special,” says Eddy. Mission accomplished.

Tips: Look for tellicherry black peppercorns, which are often regarded as the best in the world for their rich, complex flavor. Pepper suggests “false heat,” and also stimulates the appetite. Always use freshly ground black pepper from a pepper mill for optimal flavor. Add at the very last minute before serving.

“I think black pepper and the whole rainbow of peppercorns are among the most underrated spices in the kitchen.

“My personal preference is to serve fruit only at the end of a meal, but persimmons are an exception: They are not too sweet, and not too overwhelming in flavor, so they are easy to use at other points in a meal. I’ve served a mid-menu dish of chilled persimmon with tofu paste, and I also think sesame paste accents it well.”

Tips: Opt for organic popcorn, as non-organic popcorn is on the USDA’s top 10 list of foods contaminated with toxic chemicals and pesticides. Spritz with a little soy sauce for flavor and saltiness—or with a little olive oil and a sprinkle of cheesy-tasting nutritional yeast for a dose of vitamin B12.

Washington Post food editor Joe Yonan, author of Eat Your Vegetables, created his own version of the addictive herbed popcorn produced by Seventh-day Adventist vegetarian restaurant Little Lad’s, which features oil-popped popcorn seasoned with nutritional yeast, dried oregano, dried dill, dried thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, and an optional shake of fine sea salt.

POTATOES—IN GENERAL, WITH SKIN


Season: year-round, esp. summer–winter



Flavor: neutral, with earthy notes, and a starchy texture



Volume: quiet



What they are: vegetable—starchy



Nutritional profile: 93% carbs / 6% protein / 1% fats



Calories: 70 per ½-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake (whole, wrapped in foil, at 400°F, about 50–60 minutes), boil (note: use the leftover, nutritious water for sauces, soups), deep-fry, fry, grill, mash (esp. older, starchier potatoes), puree, roast (quartered, 20–40 minutes at 400°F), sauté, steam, stuff



Tips: Opt for organic potatoes. Leave the skins on for extra flavor, texture, and nutrition. Scrub well before cooking. Boil potatoes whole, not cut, so they don’t absorb water. Before baking potatoes, poke with a fork several times so steam can escape. Potatoes are America’s favorite vegetable (especially as French fries!), but don’t forget the importance of enjoying a wide variety of vegetables to ensure yourself the benefits of an equally wide variety of nutrients.

PRESSURE-COOKING


Tip: Cooks foods 50–70 percent faster than traditional methods—which is especially helpful when it comes to slow-cooking foods such as dried beans and grains.





“I love pressure-cooking beans and grains, not only because it’s faster but because it makes them more digestible. Chickpeas that would normally take hours and hours of boiling will be done in 60 minutes in a pressure-cooker. The only beans I won’t pressure-cook are white beans, because it makes them too mushy for our arugula salad that features them. And you shouldn’t pressure-cook split peas or soybeans because they foam, which can clog the mechanism and make it explode—something I unfortunately learned the hard way after just painting my kitchen.… Brown rice can pressure-cook in just 40 minutes, and only needs a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio, because you don’t need much liquid when pressure-cooking.”

LEGUMES (see also specific BEANS, CHICKPEAS, LENTILS, PEANUTS, PEAS, and SOYBEANS)


Tip: Many chefs are experimenting with smoking legumes to enhance their “meatiness.”





Cooking Legumes


There are three major categories of legumes:

pulses, including chickpeas, lentils, dried beans, dried peas

fresh beans and fresh peas

peanuts and soybeans



It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of legumes you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, here are some helpful rules of thumb:

Rinse legumes to remove any dirt or foreign objects (e.g., tiny pebbles).

Soak most legumes overnight in water before cooking. This shortens their cooking time and increases their digestibility. Discard the soaking water. (If time is of the essence, legumes can still benefit from a quick soak achieved by bringing them to a boil in water, then removing from heat, and letting them stand for at least an hour. Drain and rinse before proceeding.)

Combine legumes with cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, partially covering the pot, and simmer. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved, and then remove from heat.





LEMONGRASS


Flavor: sour/sweet, with notes of citrus (e.g., lemon or lemon zest) and/or flowers



Volume: quiet–moderate/loud



What it is: Southeast Asian grass used as a flavoring



Techniques: puree, simmer



Tips: Use fresh. Remove whole stalks after cooking and before serving. Otherwise, puree or slice these fibrous stalks very, very thinly.



Possible substitute: lemon zest

“I learned how to make black lentils when I cooked for two years at Bucara in Delhi, which is one of the best Indian restaurants in the world. After soaking them overnight and draining them, we would slow-boil them over low heat for two hours before seasoning them with ginger, garlic paste, tomato puree, salt, chili powder, unsalted butter, and heavy cream. They were so rich and delicious that we’d make 50 or 60 pounds of them every day to serve 300 guests! I still make them the same way today.”

MEDITERRANEAN CUISINES (see GREEK CUISINE, ITALIAN CUISINE—SOUTHERN, etc.)



“So much Mediterranean food is inherently vegan, which is why we refer to Crossroads as a Mediterranean restaurant. We don’t use the word ‘vegan’ here. This way, the food is not seen as foreign to people who eat here. At Crossroads, people are not eating tofu or tempeh or seitan, whose textures are foreign to most people. While I like tempeh, you are not going to convince someone to go vegan if that is the first thing they try. People need familiar food that is transitional, and that will depend on the person. Our spanakopita or spiced chickpeas are dishes people are already acquainted with, and our risotto is the least threatening dish on the menu and something that people have already had.”

Make Your Own Almond Milk


Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company says it’s easy to make your own delicious almond milk by

soaking raw almonds overnight

draining them

combining soaked almonds with fresh water in a 1:3 ratio in a Vitamix

straining the milk through a fine-mesh nut milk bag

adding cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)



You can also cook down almond milk, adding a pinch of pectin, then chill, to create a yogurt-like almond cream to enjoy on its own or with berries, granola, etc.

“We make our own coconut milk–based ice creams and use Irish moss to stabilize them. We’ll even top them with ‘whipped cream’ from a siphon, which is also coconut milk-based. Coconut Bliss is a fantastic Oregon-based dairy-free ‘ice cream’ made with coconut milk and agave, which was recently sold to a dairy.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)




“We have a new vegan truck for selling burgers, and desserts like our Vegan Fat Boys, which are vegan brownies filled with coconut milk–based Coconut Bliss ice cream. The texture is very rich and creamy, not icy, and its flavor is not overpowering.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“We make our ice cream from a blend of coconut milk and soy milk, which prevents the flavor, texture, and color of either milk from interfering with that of the ice cream. The result is a very thick and creamy ice cream.… Our roast pumpkin ice cream is accented mostly by cinnamon, but also allspice, cloves, and nutmeg.… Coconut milk has such a high fat content that all you need to do is add a bit of powdered sugar and run it through a charged canister to have nice, thick whipped cream.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)




“Our signature ice cream starts with coconut cream, organic unrefined cane sugar, agave, and a trace amount of plant-based stabilizers (guar and xanthan gum), and works well with exotic spicy and savory flavors, such as toasted pine nut and fennel, or Mexican chocolate with cayenne and cinnamon, or Thai chili peanut. Our nut-based flavors are made with an almond and cashew blend, and work best with more traditional flavors like caramel, chocolate, cookie, peanut butter, and vanilla. Our soft ice cream flavors are made with a soy base.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)




“Coconut milk is fantastic—it’s saved our lives in being able to serve our vegan guests. We use it a lot in vegan desserts, like our coconut milk panna cotta. The mouthfeel is not the same as when making a dairy panna cotta, so you’ve got to use a bit more vanilla and sugar. And we’ve made mousses by putting a mixture of coconut milk and agar-agar through an iSi whipped cream dispenser.”

—MARK LEVY, THE POINT (SARANAC LAKE, NY)





MILK, GOAT


Flavor: salty/sour/ sweet



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Can be easier to digest given its lower level of lactose (4.1%) than cow’s milk (4.7%) and the absence of cow’s milk’s main problem-causing protein (alpha SI casein). Sweeten and reduce over medium heat to make cajeta (a thick Mexican caramel sauce).

“We tested lots of different nondairy milks to come up with our recipe for a latte with the creamy richness of cow’s milk, which is half hemp milk and half coconut milk, plus agave nectar as a sweetener, added to two shots of espresso. Either will be good on its own, but the fat from the coconut milk adds great richness, while the hemp milk adds a more understated nutty flavor, and together they foam up really well.”

Nutritional profile: 82% carbs / 11% protein / 7% fat



Calories: 210 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 6 grams



Techniques: dry roast, marinate, pressure-cook, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Simmer about 15–20 minutes (chewier) to 30–40 minutes (softer), until desired tenderness is reached.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup millet to 2–3 cups liquid. Use more liquid for softer texture; also, given its flavor neutrality, use vegetable stock instead of water.)



Tips: Toast before steaming to bring out its flavor. Marinate, or cook risotto-style: Sauté millet before adding liquid to simmer slowly.



Possible substitute: couscous

“When I opened Verbena [in 1994], I would go to Kalustyan’s [the famed Manhattan spice and specialty food store] and buy unusual grains to serve. Millet was never used at other restaurants at the time. In Verbena’s review in The New York Times, it was referred to as ‘bird seed.’ So you see how much times have changed!”

What it is: Japanese fermented soybean paste, available in countless different varieties in Japan—as many varieties as there are types of cheese available in the U.S.!



Nutritional profile: 55% carbs / 25% fat / 20% protein



Calories: 275 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 16 grams



Techniques: To protect miso’s nutritional value, never bring to a boil.



Tips: Mix light and dark misos for more complex flavors. Add miso to mashed or pureed vegetables and use as a sauce. Also, customize miso soup by the season; for example, in spring/summer, use light miso + basil + green beans, and in autumn/winter, use dark miso + Brussels sprouts + garlic.

“If green vegetables are the king of Super Immunity, mushrooms are the queen.… White, cremini, portobello, oyster, maitake, and reishi mushrooms have all been shown to have anticancer effects.”

—DR. JOEL FUHRMAN, IN SUPER IMMUNITY




“Bottom line, mushrooms are good medicine. Cook them well before eating them and enjoy a variety rather than any one specific type.”

—DR. ANDREW WEIL, ON DRWEIL.COM




“Raw mushrooms are technically not supposed to be good for you. Also, the texture you get from them when they are cooked is much more exciting than when they are raw. So how do you give your mushrooms flavor without heat [as in raw cuisine]? You do it with citrus and salt because they will bring out a lot of flavor and enhance its texture. If you rub a mushroom with salt, the water comes out and the solids collapse and it becomes soft.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Abalone mushrooms, which are available in August and again in February through April in the Pacific Northwest, are incredibly meaty, meaty mushrooms. They’re giant, about five inches in diameter. I’ll slice them thick, score them, and poach them for an hour in butter, cognac, shallot, garlic, parsley, and thyme until they’re soft, and serve them with candied pistachios.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“I love trumpet mushrooms, which are milder in flavor and have the texture of scallops. They take marinades really well.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I’ll slice large Trumpet Royale mushrooms into scallops, whose great texture they resemble, although they’re not as yielding or buttery. They can be woody, so I’ll acidulate them with lemon juice, which makes them tender and lovely, and their residual sugar helps with their caramelization when I sauté them in garlic and olive oil.”

“We’ve been making our Hen of the Woods mushroom pâté for years now, and it tastes like wild, foraged maitakes. We sear them in olive oil with caramelized onions, shallots, garlic, thyme, mushroom stock, and port (like traditional pâté), and finish them with mascarpone and truffle oil. We use agar-agar to make a port gelée.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“We serve a roasted maitake mushroom with celery root fritter and grilled leek rémoulade. We love the texture of the mushroom because it is a wedge, so you get the singed, frilly little edge of the mushroom along with the juicy succulent base.”

—RICH LANDAU AND KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

“There is nothing on the planet like matsutake mushrooms! You’ve got to treat them delicately. I’ve served them with housemade buckwheat noodles, or simply grilled over rice.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)




“There may be no more prized ingredient in Japanese cuisine than matsutake mushrooms. They are as celebrated in Japan as truffles are in Italy or France. I love the texture of the mushroom, and will never forget a shockingly good version of a sukiyaki dish I tasted that featured them. But that dish was like a short-distance dash—and I like serving them cooked in a pot as a dobin mushi, which really celebrates their lasting flavor and is more like a long-distance marathon.”

“The inspiration for my artichoke oysters dish [which is served with artichoke puree, crispy oyster mushrooms, yellow tomato béarnaise, and kelp caviar] came from peeling an artichoke one day. I was peeling the leaves and one fell on a plate on its back and it looked like an oyster shell. One of the things I love to do is re-create dishes I love that I miss being a vegan and dishes that are unexpected in a vegan diet. The inspiration was nature, and it turned into ‘oysters Rockefeller.’ ”

Chef Colin Bedford of North Carolina’s Fearrington House on Mushrooms


At the Fearrington House, we treat mushrooms very much like meat. We will take larger king oyster or maitake mushrooms and confit them whole in olive oil, or we will sous-vide them as that is another great technique to infuse flavor and to create layers of flavors. The flavors differ throughout the year. In March, we use thyme, garlic, and white wine, as the wine really brightens the flavor.

King Oysters are nice, big, fat mushrooms. We will confit them with garlic, bay leaf, and thyme. The ratio of stalk to cap is crazy—like 5 percent cap to 95 percent stalk, so we use the stalk for carpaccio, cooking the mushrooms at 85°C for one to one-and-a-half hours with lots of aromatics. Once they are cool, we slice them thin on a mandoline and lay them on the plate. With the dish, we add crosnes, which are like a really cool artichoke; sunchokes, roasted cippolini onions, and garlic chips for a crispy texture.

Maitake mushrooms are my favorite. They have a meaty quality and are so versatile. We will confit them whole. Sunchokes work really well with them, as does ginger, which gives it a warm, earthy tone—with fresh ginger adding heat, and candied ginger mellowing the flavor. I’ll also use sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup—we use Mikuni Wild Harvest’s NOBLE maple syrup.

Chanterelles are another favorite. Thyme is one of my favorite pairings, as is sage; I will use one or the other. In the fall or winter, black garlic also works well with them: We will caramelize and puree the garlic, which has a kind of fermented quality that brings up sweetness, and from there we will add some Madeira and maple [syrup] for more flavor. Chanterelles are a mushroom that we don’t cook to order. We like to cook them beforehand and stew them down with aromatics, butter, and just a pinch of white wine at the end to balance the flavors.

Matsutakes call for keeping it simple, so we don’t mess around with them too much, and simply confit them. After they are cooked, we will score and then pan sear them so you get that contrasting texture.

Doubloons are smaller than shiitake mushrooms, but we treat them the same way.





Pickling Mushrooms with Colin Bedford


Beech mushrooms are perfect for pickling, as they are essentially sponges. A cremini would be too hard; you would just get little nuggets. When pickling mushrooms, the pickling solution will depend on the season, which will influence our choice of vinegar—for example:

• Autumn: madeira and sherry vinegars

• Winter: port wine, red wine, and raspberry vinegars

• Spring: lemon and chardonnay vinegars

• Summer: white balsamic and champagne vinegars





MUSTARD, e.g., DIJON (see also GREENS, MUSTARD; MUSTARD POWDER; MUSTARD SEEDS)


Flavor: bitter; hot, with peppery, spicy notes



Volume: moderate–very loud



Tips: For most purposes, choose Dijon mustard (made with verjus instead of vinegar); other options include stone-ground and/or whole-grain mustard. Add mustard at the end of the cooking process.

“During a kaiseki menu, you want to make a certain impact with the very first course, and to make sure the main course itself is outstanding.

NORI (aka LAVER)


[NOR-ee]



Flavor: salty, with notes of the sea, and the texture of handmade paper



Volume: quiet (as is)–moderate (after toasting)



What it is: dried and pressed sheets of seaweed, typically used to wrap sushi, hand rolls, and nori (aka maki) rolls

“When I visited France, I noticed that every house I visited smelled of nutmeg! I use fresh whole nutmeg in my potatoes Dauphinois. I will also add nutmeg to the yam I make with cinnamon, bay leaf, thyme, and few other ingredients. I will also add it to potatoes, cream, garlic, and thyme. It even works with sautéed spinach and greens as balance to the bitterness.”

Flavor: slightly sweet, with notes of nuts, and a chewy and/or creamy texture (when cooked)



Volume: quiet



What it is: whole grain



Nutritional profile: 70% carbs / 15% protein / 15% fats



Calories: 110 per 1-ounce serving (uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer



Timing: Cook Scottish oats about 10 minutes, or old-fashioned (aka rolled) oats about 10–15 minutes, covered; steel-cut oats will cook in about 30 minutes, although cooking time can be cut by presoaking.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup oats to 2–3 cups liquid, e.g., almond milk or water)



Tips: To make a creamier oatmeal, use Scottish oats and/or substitute milk (e.g., almond) for some or all of the water. For chewier oatmeal, opt for steel-cut oats. In-between? You might prefer good old-fashioned rolled oats. Whole oat groats can be used in savory dishes, such as pilafs.

OIL—IN GENERAL


Virtually all oils have about 120 calories per 1-tablespoon serving, and are high in fats and low in nutrients.



Tips: Select an oil based on its intended purpose, e.g., finishing dishes (e.g., extra-virgin olive, flavored), or low-, medium-, or high-temperature (e.g., grapeseed, peanut, safflower) cooking. Always opt for unrefined and less processed oils (e.g., “expeller-pressed” or “cold pressed”), which are free of chemicals and solvents, and choose organic corn and soybean oils.

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, CANOLA


Flavor: neutral



Volume: quiet



What it is: rapeseed oil from CANada (which is where it gets its name)



Techniques: bake, fry, sauté



Tips: Use only organic, expeller-pressed canola oil, as many canola oils are made from GMO seeds; otherwise, opt for another oil altogether. Use as fresh as possible, and check regularly for rancidity (as it goes rancid quickly). Canola oil can be used for medium- (e.g., baking) to high-temperature (e.g., frying) cooking. Use with boldly flavored dishes that would obscure the flavor of more expensive oils.

“I’ll blend coconut oil with cacao powder to make raw truffles, while I use coconut butter in raw desserts.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“The choice of oil in baking is important. For cookies I will use canola, grapeseed, or coconut oil. The coconut oil is used in our doughnuts and cakes as well, but you have to be careful so that the flavor does not become overpowering.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Coconut oil is a liquid when it’s at 72°F and up, and a solid with the texture of butter or shortening at temperatures below 72°F. When we make biscuits, we’ll use solid coconut oil and cut it into the dough, which results in a layering effect and flakier biscuits. We’ll also cut solid coconut oil into our pancake batter, where it has a leavening effect that makes our pancakes light and fluffy—more so than with canola oil.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)





OIL, FLAXSEED


What’s healthful about it: omega-3 fatty acids



Tips: Flaxseeds are said to be even higher in lignans than flaxseed oil is. Heating flaxseed oil destroys its nutrients. Store in the refrigerator.

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA, CA)





OIL, HAZELNUT


Flavor: notes of hazelnuts



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Use for low- to medium-temperature cooking (e.g., baking, sautéing), or as a finishing oil. Use caution when cooking, as hazelnut oil burns easily. Store in the refrigerator, and use within a few months after opening.

OIL, OLIVE


Flavor: earthy notes of fruit and/or olives, with a rich texture



Volume: quieter (e.g., lighter-colored virgin)–louder (e.g., deeper-colored extra-virgin)



Techniques: bake, fry, raw, sauté (on low heat)



Tips: Use raw, or warm only to low temperatures. Opt for lighter, quieter virgin (aka “pure”) oil for baking, frying, grilling, roasting, and sautéing, and darker, louder extra-virgin oil for dressing salads or drizzling on bruschetta or pizza. For salad dressings, the typical ratio is one part vinegar to three or four parts extra-virgin olive oil, but those looking to lower the fat in their diets (not to mention calories) should consider using less oil.

“I can sum up in two words the difference between vegetarian cooking in the 1970s vs. today: olive oil. Back then, it was common to mask dishes with the richness of butter and cream. Olive oil lets more of the flavor shine through, particularly dishes made with garlic and herbs.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR




“One you’ve fallen in love with the flavor of extra-virgin olive oil, there’s no place to go after that. I’ll only use it to finish dishes. For high-heat cooking, I use canola, grapeseed, or safflower oil—or some combination thereof.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

ORGANIC PRODUCE


Tip: Opt for organic produce whenever possible—and definitely when you buy one of the Environmental Working Group (EWG)’s so-called “Dirty Dozen Plus” fruits or vegetables, which are those most affected by chemical contamination, i.e., apples, bell peppers, celery, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers, collard greens, cucumbers, grapes, kale, nectarines (imported), peaches, potatoes, spinach, strawberries, and summer squash.



The EWG notes that “[t]he health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure. Use EWG’s Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides™ to reduce your exposures as much as possible, but eating conventionally-grown produce is far better than not eating fruits and vegetables at all.”

“I love parsley as a flavor. Parsley risotto is amazing, and its color is as vibrant as its flavor. There is more to parsley than just the leaf; I use the stems and roots as well. The stems add good texture, and I use them to add crunch to soups. As for the root, which has an herbaceousness similar to parsnips, I like to roast and puree them for soups as well.… People also need to remember that there is more than flat-leaf parsley out there. I am a fan of curly parsley, which is often overlooked and has an intense, almost celery-like flavor. There was a time in America when you couldn’t serve a plate without the orange wedge and curly parsley.”

“If I’m serving a smooth pureed parsnip soup, I’ll layer other parsnip flavors into the dish—for example, both cooked and raw parsnips, fried parsnip chips, and a confited parsnip ‘butter.’ I’ll keep working to think of new ways to get more parsnip flavor into the dish one more time—like taking the parsnip oil from confited parsnips and reemulsifying it back into the soup. All together, the flavor becomes so much more impactful.”

“There are entire regions of Italy that make pasta without eggs. Gnocchi is made without eggs in Liguria [so it’s naturally vegan]. I don’t use eggs in my ravioli dough—I use tapioca flour. I sometimes stuff ravioli with thick cashew cream, or kale, or a vegetable puree. I’ve served English pea ravioli with morels, mint, lemon zest, and sweated shallots.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)

Talking with Chef Chris Eddy of Winvian about Cooking for Vegetarians


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was a simple vegetarian pappardelle dish I was served at Winvian, a unique Connecticut resort that houses eighteen individually designed cottages, including a helicopter and a treehouse. It featured a green sauce, along with sautéed cauliflower, mushrooms, and onions, and a very light dusting of grated cheese on top. The creamy sauce turned out to be a steamed broccoli puree made in a Vitamix with a bit of ice (“to cool the broccoli as quickly as possible,” according to chef Chris Eddy), some clear vegetable stock (“so as not to interfere with the beautiful green color”), a hint of heat in the form of either cayenne or chili pepper flakes (“always—it’s a ‘calling card’ that leaves an impression even after you’ve finished eating”), and just a touch of brown butter (“to add an amazing dimension to the sauce”). It’s based on a “ridiculously simple” technique Eddy learned while working with Chef Alain Ducasse and, I can attest, it’s ridiculously delicious.

Eddy says the technique works just as well with other vegetables—whether cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, or parsnips—and if added richness is desired, one could substitute cream for some of the clear vegetable stock (“although its whiteness fades the bright colors”), though the dish is creamy and rich even without added cream.

While Eddy characterizes Winvian’s customers as about 35 to 40 percent pescetarian, he and chef de cuisine Patrick Espinoza and their kitchen team spent a month eating vegetarian during the summer of 2013, just for the experience of putting themselves into the shoes of the significant portion of Winvian’s clientele (“about 7 or 8 percent of our customers”) who eat vegetarian. Why? “Number one, we love vegetables,” Eddy admits. But out of compassion for Winvian’s vegetarian customers, “We wanted to ‘feel their pain.’ We came to understand their frustration [at other restaurants] of only being offered the same dishes again and again—whether eggplant Parmesan, or risotto, or a salad—when they went out to dine.” In addition to prompting Eddy and his team to come up with an ever-changing array of dishes like the incredible pappardelle I fell in love with, their month-long vegetarian experiment had an added bonus: a number of Eddy’s cooks discovered that they felt healthier and sometimes less irritable.

“Now, we like to go all out for our vegetarian guests, and give them something special,” says Eddy. Mission accomplished.

Flavor: hot (and sometimes sweet); aromatic, with pungent notes of cloves, lemon, and/or wood



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Look for tellicherry black peppercorns, which are often regarded as the best in the world for their rich, complex flavor. Pepper suggests “false heat,” and also stimulates the appetite. Always use freshly ground black pepper from a pepper mill for optimal flavor. Add at the very last minute before serving.

“I think black pepper and the whole rainbow of peppercorns are among the most underrated spices in the kitchen. Peppercorns are truly berries—they are sweet, fruity, and spicy—so a great pepper adds a lot of flavor. I’ve served cauliflower crusted with pepper, and the pepper helped the cauliflower sing on the plate.”

“My personal preference is to serve fruit only at the end of a meal, but persimmons are an exception: They are not too sweet, and not too overwhelming in flavor, so they are easy to use at other points in a meal. I’ve served a mid-menu dish of chilled persimmon with tofu paste, and I also think sesame paste accents it well.”

What it is: whole grain



What’s healthful about it: high in fiber, low in calories (when air-popped)



Tips: Opt for organic popcorn, as non-organic popcorn is on the USDA’s top 10 list of foods contaminated with toxic chemicals and pesticides. Spritz with a little soy sauce for flavor and saltiness—or with a little olive oil and a sprinkle of cheesy-tasting nutritional yeast for a dose of vitamin B12.

Washington Post food editor Joe Yonan, author of Eat Your Vegetables, created his own version of the addictive herbed popcorn produced by Seventh-day Adventist vegetarian restaurant Little Lad’s, which features oil-popped popcorn seasoned with nutritional yeast, dried oregano, dried dill, dried thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, and an optional shake of fine sea salt.

POTATOES—IN GENERAL, WITH SKIN


Season: year-round, esp. summer–winter



Flavor: neutral, with earthy notes, and a starchy texture



Volume: quiet



What they are: vegetable—starchy



Nutritional profile: 93% carbs / 6% protein / 1% fats



Calories: 70 per ½-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake (whole, wrapped in foil, at 400°F, about 50–60 minutes), boil (note: use the leftover, nutritious water for sauces, soups), deep-fry, fry, grill, mash (esp. older, starchier potatoes), puree, roast (quartered, 20–40 minutes at 400°F), sauté, steam, stuff



Tips: Opt for organic potatoes. Leave the skins on for extra flavor, texture, and nutrition. Scrub well before cooking. Boil potatoes whole, not cut, so they don’t absorb water. Before baking potatoes, poke with a fork several times so steam can escape. Potatoes are America’s favorite vegetable (especially as French fries!), but don’t forget the importance of enjoying a wide variety of vegetables to ensure yourself the benefits of an equally wide variety of nutrients.

PRESSURE-COOKING


Tip: Cooks foods 50–70 percent faster than traditional methods—which is especially helpful when it comes to slow-cooking foods such as dried beans and grains.





“I love pressure-cooking beans and grains, not only because it’s faster but because it makes them more digestible. Chickpeas that would normally take hours and hours of boiling will be done in 60 minutes in a pressure-cooker. The only beans I won’t pressure-cook are white beans, because it makes them too mushy for our arugula salad that features them. And you shouldn’t pressure-cook split peas or soybeans because they foam, which can clog the mechanism and make it explode—something I unfortunately learned the hard way after just painting my kitchen.… Brown rice can pressure-cook in just 40 minutes, and only needs a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio, because you don’t need much liquid when pressure-cooking.”

—PAM BROWN, GARDEN CAFÉ ON THE GREEN (WOODSTOCK, NY)

QUINOA


[KEEN-wah]



Flavor: bitter/slightly sweet, with earthy notes of couscous, grass, herbs, millet, nuts, and/or sesame, and a light and fluffy (when cooked), slightly crunchy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: often thought of as a whole grain, even though it’s the fruit of an herb, not a grain



What’s healthful about it: Most quinoa contains 15–20% protein (higher than the typical 14% of wheat, 9–11% of millet, and 7–8% of rice), and is richer in calcium than milk.



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 71% carbs / 15% protein / 14% fat



Calories: 220 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 8 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Cooks in 10–15 (white) to 20 (red) to 30 (black) minutes.



Ratio: 1: 1½–2 (1 cup quinoa to 1½–2 cups liquid, e.g., stock, water)



Tips: Quinoa must be rinsed very well before cooking, to remove all traces of bitterness (and “suds” from the rinse water). Toast first before using in dishes to enhance its flavor. For enhanced flavor and texture, try sautéing for 5 minutes before adding liquid—and/or substituting vegetable stock or juice, or fruit juice (e.g., orange or passion fruit), for some or all of the water. Fluff with a fork after cooking to separate the grains (and remember that black and red quinoa won’t stick together as much as white). Quinoa doesn’t get mushy, even when overcooked.

“Eating plain white quinoa can be like eating bird food. What I like to do is mix it with red and black quinoa, which gives you great flavor and texture with some nuttiness and chew to it.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB RESTAURANT (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love quinoa. I especially like making quinoa tabbolueh. I add onions, tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, lemon, and salt. You don’t have to cook it that long and it absorbs all the flavors.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Every ingredient in our dishes is there for a reason—either flavor, texture, and/or its health benefit. Quinoa is kind of our ‘house grain’ because of all of the above—it’s great in salads, and golden quinoa is one of two key ingredients [along with black beans] in our signature Root veggie burger. Our burgers are also made with pureed carrots, garlic, onions, and breadcrumbs seasoned with black pepper and paprika before shaping into patties. To achieve their meaty texture, they’re cooked twice—the first time slowly on low heat on the grill, and the second time seared on high heat to crisp it.”

RICE, ARBORIO (aka RISOTTO)


Flavor: neutral, with a firm chalky center and a starchy, creamy surface (when cooked)



Volume: quiet



Techniques: Sauté rice in butter or oil until white. Stir while gradually adding hot/boiling liquid (e.g., vegetable stock) and simmering, about 20 minutes.



Ratio: 1: 3–3½ (1 cup rice to 3–3½ cups cooking liquid, e.g., juice, stock, water, and/or wine)



Tips: Let the seasons inspire your risotto pairings, e.g., basil and tomato in summer, wild mushrooms in autumn. Try the same flavor pairings with “risottos” made from other grains, e.g., barley, farro. Look for brown Arborio rice, which is higher in nutrients.



Possible substitutes: baldo rice, carnaroli rice (which, while less widely available, makes the creamiest—and arguably the best—risotto), vialone nano rice

What’s healthful about it: twice the fiber and protein of brown rice



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 83% carbs / 14% protein / 3% fats



Calories: 170 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 7 grams

ROOT VEGETABLES—IN GENERAL, or MIXED (see also BEETS, CARROTS, PARSNIPS, RUTABAGAS, SWEET POTATOES, TURNIPS, etc.)



“I’ll confit root vegetables—like carrots, celery root, parsley root, and parsnips—that have been shaved thin on a mandoline in olive oil with herbs, spices, and citrus for six to eight hours in an 85°F oven, which breaks down their cell wall structure. As they become tender, their water is replaced with fat. I strain and puree them, which creates the texture of room-temperature butter. Because this ‘root vegetable butter’ has the same qualities as butter or soft cheese, I can use it in similar ways, such as on canapés or to bind other ingredients.”

“Anytime you combine rosemary and thyme, you’ve got instant Thanksgiving! Their soulful, dark, rich flavors will enhance anything, from a bag of chips to a mushroom dish. But rosemary is very pungent, so you only need a little. I won’t add rosemary to a soup: by the time rosemary turns gray, it’s given everything it has to give, and you want it out of there anyway. Instead, I’ll use a rosemary branch to stir the soup and infuse the flavor.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





RUTABAGAS


Season: autumn–spring



Flavor: sweet/sometimes bitter, with sometimes sharp, peppery, and/or pungent notes of cabbage, nuts, and/or turnips, and a crisp texture



Volume: moderate (esp. cooked)–loud (esp. raw)



What they are: root vegetables



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 9% protein / 5% fats



Calories: 70 per 1-cup serving (cooked, cubed)

“Every dish needs a vibrant quality about it. In a leafy green salad, when you toss it and serve it, it doesn’t have the leaves all upside down so their backs are to someone. I call it ‘fluffy and lofty’—the greens twins—that make the salad inviting. If you list a bunch of ingredients in the salad, don’t hide them all at the bottom. Make sure the stand-out ingredients stand out. And don’t go cheap: three extra cherry tomatoes is not going to break the bank. You want a person to feel that you care every step of the way.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)





The Secret to Loving Salads: A Great Salad Dressing


One of the most healthful and flavorful changes you can make to your diet is to eat more vegetables—a lot more vegetables. At least half of them should be eaten raw, such as in salads. Keeping things flavorful through mastering a compelling array of salad dressings is a worthwhile pursuit.

Don’t undo the good you’ve done by using typical oil-laden dressings, which clock in at nearly 120 calories per tablespoon (like pure fat itself). Below are some ways to cut calories and fat without eliminating flavor:


Ratio: The standard radio is 1:3 or 1:4 (1 part vinegar to 3 or 4 parts oil), but consider minimizing (if not eliminating) oil in salad dressings.


Tips: Always start the process of making salad dressing with the vinegar and/or citrus (e.g., lemon, lime, orange) juice and seasonings (e.g., citrus zest, herbs; minced garlic, onions, or shallots; spices), and slowly whisk in any oil. If too much oil is added, the flavor balance will be lost. For more Omega-3s, consider substituting flaxseed or walnut oil for part of the extra-virgin olive oil. With citrus vinaigrettes, use a lighter vinegar, e.g., champagne, rice, or sherry. Those looking to minimize or eliminate oil can base salad dressings on other liquids or pastes, such as buttermilk, fruit juice, kefir, nut butters, tahini, vegetable juice or stock, vinegar, yogurt, and/or water—or even pureed fruit, silken tofu, or vegetables (e.g., avocados). To make vegetarian dressings creamier, add a little cream cheese, fresh goat cheese, kefir, mascarpone, or ricotta; vegans can blend with nutritional yeast or silken tofu.

Not only great for salads, the combinations listed in this section can also be used for dips, dipping sauces, marinades, sautés, or stir-fries—or drizzled over hot vegetables, Asian noodles, or pastas.





Talking with Charleen Badman of FnB in Scottsdale about Making a Great Salad


For a great salad, you need the elements of crunch, sweetness, savoriness, and fattiness.

Crunch: “For crunch in a salad, I can use a variety of things beyond nuts. I like to use things in the onion family—for example, julienning and salting onions, and frying them in olive oil. Leeks and shallots both crisp up well and can be used as a garnish. I also like using puffed rice to add texture.”

Sweetness: “Sweetness can be added with fresh fruits, like apples or pears; dried fruits like raisins; or even sweet vegetables like corn or tomatoes.”

Savoriness: “Adding some spice is also a great way to enhance a salad. You can do it with some chili pepper or even raw fresh ginger, which tastes great with rutabaga.”

Fattiness: “To add fat, there are many options. You can select a fatty vegetable, like an avocado. You can use a mayonnaise turned into aioli. Cheese is good in dressings, as are infused olive oils.”

SALT—IN GENERAL



“Because of my French training, fleur de sel is one of the salts I rely on most. Its flavor is perfect with tomatoes. I’ll use Malden sea salt, which has lots of notes of the ocean, for dishes like roasted root vegetables. Sel gris, which often comes in blue bottles, is strong, and not as fine as other salts. I have nothing against kosher salt, but its flavor is just not what I’m used to working with.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)





SALT, BLACK


Flavor: salty; pungent with notes of eggs and/or sulphur



Volume: very loud



What it is: pinkish-gray Indian mineral salt



Tips: Look for Indian kala namak. Adds a boiled egg flavor to vegan dishes (e.g., tofu scrambles, “egg salads” made with tofu). Caution: A little goes a long way! Grind it fine to use in the smallest doses.

Flavor: salty, with notes of the sea



Volume: range from quieter (e.g., arame, wakame)–louder (e.g., hiziki)



What’s healthful about them: very high in essential and trace minerals



Tips: Kept in a cool, dry area, sea vegetables store beautifully. Soak dried sea vegetables in cold water for 5+ minutes to reconstitute before cooking (and to reduce sodium). Serve either cold or hot.





“If you dry sea lettuce, it tastes just like black truffles—it’s an umami bomb! You can find sea lettuce along the San Mateo coast, and harvest it in the wintertime—just dry it and grind it to a powder to use to season sea vegetable salads or onigiri.”

SEITAN (see also tips for NAMA-FU)


[SAY-tahn]



Flavor: neutral, with a meaty (e.g., chicken cutlet-like) texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: a meat substitute made from wheat gluten, nicknamed “wheat meat”



Nutritional profile: 81% protein / 15% carbs / 4% fat



Calories: 105 calories per 1-ounce serving (vital wheat gluten)



Protein: 21 grams



Techniques: bake, barbecue, fry, grill, marinate, pan-sear, sauté, sear, steam, stew, stir-fry



Tips: For peak flavor, be sure to marinate the seitan for at least a few hours. Add texture through seasoned crusts, e.g., herbs, panko. Use seitan “scraps” for sauces, soups, taco fillings. Seitan also freezes well.

You can easily make your own seitan from scratch with vital wheat gluten, seasoning it to taste (e.g., as you would making your own chorizo or gyros). However, if you’re just getting started, you might try one of Arrowhead Mills’s quick mixes or a Knox Mountain mix. You can also find commercially prepared seitan from national brands like Lightlife and WhiteWave, or local producers like The Bridge (Middleton, CT).

“Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are the holy trinity of vegetarianism. Seitan is my favorite because of its versatility.”

—JOY PIERSON, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I love serving seitan with a crunchy crust, such as crushed cashews, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, or even quinoa. Instead of egg wash, we’ll dip the seitan in a vegan mixture of water, lemon juice, garlic, and nutritional yeast before crusting and sautéing.”

—ANGEL RAMOS, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I don’t know of any other vegetarian restaurant that offered a vegetarian Reuben sandwich before we did. Ours is made with a seitan-based pastrami ‘wheat meat,’ a little sauerkraut, spicy mustard, Thousand Island dressing, and Vegenaise on oversized Jewish rye bread, which you can get with either Swiss cheese, vegan cheese, or—my favorite—cottage-style tofu, which is mashed tofu seasoned with garlic, chives, and onions. I’ve probably eaten two hundred of them over the past ten years. In the beginning, we used to make our Reubens with vegetarian bacon bits, which softened on the sandwich, which was spread with a layer of Vegenaise. But the seitan version is more authentic.”

SMOKING


Tips: It doesn’t take more than 30–60 seconds in a smoker to add a smoked flavor to many foods. You definitely don’t want to oversmoke foods, which makes them bitter and leaves an unpleasant brownish coating. Experiment with various woods for different flavors, but you’ll typically want to lean toward lighter woods like apple and cherry (which are sweeter), or perhaps oak and pecan (which are a bit louder), rather than hickory, maple, and mesquite (which are much more pronounced and can easily overwhelm fruits and vegetables).





Brand: Nordic Ware and other companies for small stovetop/grilltop smokers




“I like smoked flavors and smoke lots of different fruits and vegetables. Smoked lettuce has the flavor of a grilled hamburger. It’s comical how convincing it can be: Customers have accused us of putting bacon into our smoked potato puree dish, which evokes bacon and eggs. We’ll smoke garlic or onions and puree them for sauces—or to add a bacony note to pasta alla carbonara. Customers automatically expect raisins to taste dry, chewy, and sweet—but serving them raisins that have been pickled then smoked will make them think again.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“Sometimes I’ll add a little tequila to a black bean sauce to give it a unique smoky flavor—a sauce that would be delicious with chile-grilled seitan with collard greens and sweet plantains.”

—ANGEL RAMOS, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)

SMOOTHIES (see also JUICES)


What they are: differentiated from juices in that they contain fiber, which makes them creamy and more nutritious.



Tips: When in doubt, add a banana for texture and flavor; they combine well with many other fruits and even vegetables. For richer-tasting smoothies, use frozen fruit.





“Smoothies made with tropical fruits will hide the flavor of strong greens. One of our most popular smoothies is the Island Green, which is made with coconut, coconut water, cucumber, kale, mango, pineapple, spinach, and strawberries.”

—CASSIE AND MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)




“The seasons are an inspiration to all of us here. One autumn, I came up with an ideal seasonal treat: a sweet potato smoothie flavored with maple syrup, almond milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Every fall, we bring it back!”

—MARK DOSKOW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)





SNACKS


Tips: When you’re craving a snack, reach for one of the healthier veg options below instead of the standard American snacks of salty or sweet processed foods. For example, if you’re craving chocolate, don’t snack on candy bars or even chocolate chips—try cacao nibs.

bagel, whole grain, e.g., with nut butter

“Zucchini ‘noodles’ are soft and pliable—especially if blanched in lemon juice, which gives them a soft ‘cooked’ texture—making them the #1 raw pasta option. While using a spiralizer produces a more realistic noodle, using a mandoline is fine if you’re pressed for time.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)





SPIRALING or SPIRALIZING


Use a spiral slicer to create “pasta” (e.g., “angel hair,” “linguini,” “spaghetti”) or thin ribbons out of hard vegetables (e.g., beets, carrots, celery root, daikon, jícama, kohlrabi, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, zucchini) or even fruits (e.g., apples). To soften, toss with a bit of oil and salt (or sauté very briefly) before saucing or adding to soup.


Possible substitutes: julienne peelers, mandolines

“Spiralized jícama looks like pho noodles. I’ll add them to a vegetarian pho [Vietnamese noodle soup], or a mushroom curry made with roasted shiitakes and purple sweet potatoes, with the red curry sauce poured tableside.”

“When I see ramps come in, I know there is light at the end of the tunnel—and that I will not be using squash and potatoes much longer! I look forward to spring’s asparagus and morels, which grow in the Midwest. When June hits, it is strawberry season.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)

“We’ve juiced butternut squash to add color and flavor to risotto. I don’t like the mouthfeel that results from drying and powdering the [leftover] mulch to flavor dishes. But I’ve made a butternut squash chutney out of adding the juice back to the mulch and seasoning it with cardamom, garlic, star anise, sugar, and vinegar.”

SQUASH, SPAGHETTI


Season: late summer–winter



Flavor: slightly sweet, with the texture of crunchy (if stringy) spaghetti



Volume: quiet–moderate



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 8% fats / 6% protein



Calories: 45 per 1-cup serving (boiled or baked)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake (at 350°F about 30–90 minutes), boil (about 30–60 minutes), roast (at 400°F for 15–20 minutes), sauté, steam (20–45 minutes, until tender)



Tips: Spaghetti squash is named after the appearance of its cooked flesh, whose strands resemble the pasta. You can bake it whole (as some insist on), after puncturing it in a few places to allow steam to escape, or halved (as Andrew taught me). Use a fork to pull off strands of cooked squash. Toss or top with sauce and serve like spaghetti. Although spaghetti squash can be found as early as late summer, look to pairing tips for winter squash, which its flavor more closely resembles.

apple juice and applesauce

barley malt syrup

brown rice syrup

cane juice, evaporated

cinnamon

coconut nectar

coconut sugar

dates and date sugar

fruit, fresh, e.g., bananas

fruit, dried, e.g., dates, raisins

fruit juice, esp. concentrated, e.g., fruit syrup

fruit preserves and jams

honey, e.g., raw

maple sugar

maple syrup

mirin

molasses

nutmeg

rice syrup

stevia

sucanat, which is an acronym for sugar cane natural

“Our tapioca puddings are so popular that it’s hard to take them off our menu. Coconut milk is a source of both flavor and richness [as opposed to rice milk, which is thin and has no flavor, or soy milk, which can taste chalky]. We thicken the pudding with agar-agar, which doesn’t mask flavors, unlike cornstarch. We like to accent it with fruit in both raw and cooked form, such as fresh cherries with a cherry sauce or gel.”

“Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are the holy trinity of vegetarianism.… Tempeh is my favorite because it has the most nutrients.”

—BART POTENZA, COFOUNDER, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I prefer soy tempeh in the summertime, because it pairs well with lighter flavors like citrus, lemon, and white wine. When the weather cools down in the fall, I prefer multigrain tempeh because its earthier flavor pairs better with the season’s richer flavors of mushrooms and spices like cinnamon. I really like Surata [brand] tempeh’s texture and flavor.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I prefer tempeh to tofu or seitan because it is heartier and stands up to flavorful sauces like mole the best.”

THANKSGIVING



“If you ask people what they love about Thanksgiving food, the answer is usually what we think of as the ‘sides.’ It’s all about the herbs and spices; the sage in the stuffing and the ginger in the squash; the thyme in the gravy and the pepper in the potatoes. There are so many ways to build satisfying flavors for the holiday table. I love a nice centerpiece of course, perhaps a pot pie or a lentil roast, but I think that making sure that all of the familiar flavors are present is the most important part of the holiday table.”

TOFU—IN GENERAL


[TOH-foo]



Flavor: neutral, ranging from delicate to firm in texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: bean curd made from soybeans



Nutritional profile: 50% fats / 38% protein / 12% carbs (raw, firm)



Calories: 185 per ½-cup serving (raw, firm)



Protein: 20 grams (raw, firm)



Techniques: bake (at 350°F for 15 minutes per side), blanch (esp. before long simmering), boil (10 minutes), braise, broil, crumble, cube, freeze (after defrosting, chewiness is enhanced), fry, grill (4–5 minutes per side), marinate, pan-sear, puree, roast, sauté, slice, simmer (20 minutes), stir-fry, tempura-fry, toast



Tips: Its flavor neutrality is a boon, as tofu readily absorbs the flavors with which it is cooked. Tofu is solidified using nigari or lemon juice, so flavors that pair well with lemon often work beautifully. Rinse tofu in cold water before using, and drain well to better allow tofu to absorb seasonings. You can press out the excess water from tofu by using paper towels and heavy books or cans, but frequent tofu cooks might consider investing in a tofu press (e.g., TofuXpress).

TOFU, FIRM or EXTRA-FIRM


Flavor: neutral, with a texture that is denser and heartier than silken, yet moister than super-firm tofu



Volume: quiet



Nutritional profile: 54% fat / 38% protein / 8% carbs



Calories: 85 per -block serving (extra-firm)



Protein: 9 grams (extra-firm)



Techniques: bake, crumble, deep-fry, fry, grate (esp. extra-firm), grill, marinate, pan-fry, roast, sauté, scramble, stir-fry



Tips: Marinate overnight or for as long as several days. For a chewier texture, freeze firm or extra-firm tofu for 24+ hours, then thaw, and squeeze out water in tofu before marinating; the texture can approximate that of ground beef or chicken in dishes such as vegetarian chili or tacos. Crumble and season (e.g., with basil, garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, oregano, salt) extra-firm tofu to make a vegan ricotta cheese substitute that can be used in pastas and on pizzas.

“I like extra-firm tofu with tapenade and tomatoes. If you put extra-firm tofu through your food processor, it will come out the texture of ricotta cheese, and you can use it that way in lasagnas and other pasta dishes.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)





TOFU, FROZEN


Tips: Freezing firm or extra-firm tofu changes its texture. Once thawed and cooked, it has a chewy, meaty texture. Cubed, it approximates the texture of meat. Crumbled, it approximates the texture of ground beef.

TOFU, JAPANESE


Tip: Use when you’re looking for the softest texture.





TOFU, SCRAMBLED


Tips: Substitute crumbled firm or extra-firm tofu for scrambled eggs as a base to mix in vegetables and seasonings, e.g., avocados, bell peppers, black beans, cilantro, garlic, mushrooms, onions, parsley, scallions, spinach, tempeh bacon, tomatoes, or vegan sausage. Achieve the yellow hue of scrambled eggs via nutritional yeast or turmeric.





TOFU, SILKEN


Flavor: slightly sweet, with a creamy, moist, smooth, custard-like texture



Volume: quiet



Tips: Puree into sauces and soups to give them a creamy texture. Blend silken tofu with agave nectar and/or maple syrup plus vanilla for a vegan topping to enjoy on French toast, pancakes, or waffles—or on desserts. Do not substitute silken for regular tofu, or vice versa; use the type specified by the particular recipe.

“Tofu is so versatile! You can use it as a savory element to make a mousse or a veggie burger. If you marinate it, you can use it like a cheese and add it to salads. I add soy milk and silken tofu to polenta, then serve it with broccoli rabe. I like to marinate tofu with turmeric or with raw onion, sherry vinegar, red or green pepper, and soy sauce. Easiest of all is marinating a whole block of tofu in miso, then baking it for 20 minutes—it comes out with such a great flavor, and is even better with some brown rice and broccoli rabe.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Island Spring is the Cadillac of tofu. It takes time to develop a great product, and theirs is dense and flavorful and absorbs other flavors well.… I like to grill my tofu before marinating it, because citrus tears apart the fiber and makes it impossible to char afterward. Marinating grilled tofu pushes the flavor of the char and the marinade into the tofu.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“Our spin on tuna with wasabi is spicy grilled tofu taken in a Korean direction with gochujang, which is the paste used in bibambap. The gochujang is a little sharp, so we add bean paste for a sweet balance that is turned into a glaze to finish the tofu.”

—RICH LANDAU AND KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)

Flavor: umami



Volume: moderate–loud



What they are: black truffles that have been cultivated in Australia since 1999



Tip: Use like other black truffles (see below).





“Australian black truffles are already the equal of other [e.g., French] black truffles in terms of aroma and flavor and continue to develop a stronger, longer-lasting flavor every year. Plus, it’s fun to use truffles in the summer [which is Australia’s winter]—their earthiness is an amazing complement to the sweetness of corn agnolotti.”

VEGGIE BURGERS


There are almost as many versions of veggie burgers as there are vegetarian chefs! Play with your favorite combination of whole grains, legumes, mushrooms, nuts, seeds, and/or vegetables to come up with your own.





“I developed a veggie burger from brown rice, chickpeas, lentils, and mushrooms for a restaurant project outside Mélisse—but I’ve used the same combination as a ‘sausage’ in a bean and portobello mushroom cassoulet. There’s no casing—the broken rice serves as the binder, and I wrap it in plastic wrap and steam it before finishing it in a pan to give it a crust.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)




“We serve three different veggie burgers. My favorite is the Follow Your Heart burger, which is a meatlike soy-based patty. My second favorite is the Nut Burger Supreme, which is based on nuts and vegetables and topped with lettuce, rennetless cheddar cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, sauerkraut, Vegenaise, and carrot shreds. It’s not a cohesive patty, but more like a pâté, that’s been heated on the grill so that it squeezes out as you take a bite. We also offer a Multi-Grain Mushroom burger, which is somewhat similar in texture to the nutburger and based on brown rice, wheat berries, barley, lentils, mushrooms, and herbs.”

—BOB GOLDBERG, FOLLOW YOUR HEART (LOS ANGELES)

VERJUS


[vair-ZHOO]



Flavor: sour/sweet, often with notes of fruit



Volume: varies, from quiet to moderate-loud



What it is: juice from unripe (i.e., low-sugar, high-acid) red or white grapes



Tips: Substitute white verjus for citrus (e.g., lemon, lime) and red verjus for red wine vinegar when looking to add a quieter acid to a dish or when looking to pair the dish with wine (as it’s more wine-friendly than vinegar). In general, opt for white verjus with quieter or lighter ingredients, and earthy red verjus with louder or darker ingredients. Look for verjus from American wineries coast to coast, e.g., Navarro (CA) to Wölffer Estate (NY), as well as the French producer Roland.

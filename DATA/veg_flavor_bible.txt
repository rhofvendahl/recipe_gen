INTRODUCTION



“Over half of Americans [52 percent] believe it is easier to figure out their income taxes than to figure out what they should and shouldn’t eat to be healthier.”

—THE 2012 FOOD & HEALTH SURVEY: CONSUMER ATTITUDES TOWARD FOOD SAFETY, NUTRITION & HEALTH, COMMISSIONED BY THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD INFORMATION COUNCIL FOUNDATION




“In all my interviews with nutrition experts, the benefits of a plant-based diet provided the only point of universal consensus.”

—MICHAEL POLLAN, IN DEFENSE OF FOOD (2008)




This book started with a problem: I didn’t know what to eat.

In two decades of writing about food, I’ve have had the pleasure and privilege of interviewing many of the world’s greatest chefs while studying their secrets for making food taste great. My work-related eating (including wine-tasting lunches and dinners) often took me to the dining rooms of DANIEL, Le Bernardin, and Per Se—or, during a year spent eating at chefs’ favorite restaurants from coast to coast, sampling In-N-Out burgers, pork-and-crab soup dumplings, and both Pat’s and Geno’s cheese steaks. My life included an endless pursuit of deliciousness, and I was always thrilled to discover what I’d learn from the next bite. But as more and more headlines trumpeted the relationship between nutrition and wellness, it dawned on me that for someone who ate for a living, I’d thought surprisingly little about what to put in my body to keep myself healthy when I wasn’t busy eating for professional reasons.

After I lost both my father and stepmother to cancer between 2006 and 2009, I couldn’t help thinking about my own half-century birthday looming on the horizon. It finally occurred to me, for the first time in my life, that I might want to start including healthfulness as a criterion for choosing what to eat.

After poring over dozens of books and websites on food and nutrition, I found myself confused by varying (and often contradictory) nutritional advice. If I—a graduate of Northwestern and Harvard and longtime culinary professional—was having a tough time figuring out what makes a healthful diet, what about everyone else? I was not surprised, then, to discover that in a 2012 poll, over half of Americans polled said they found it easier to do their taxes than to figure out what to eat to keep themselves healthy. Now that’s frustration.

The general public’s lack of nutritional knowledge is tragic, because it turns out that the leading cause of death in this country is nutritionally controllable diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Diets that forego animal protein in favor of plant protein are associated with a lower risk of all three.

I eventually did find this common thread among what I learned to be the best-respected authorities: their advice to eat a plant-based diet, especially plentiful vegetables. The corollary was to avoid processed “junk” foods with empty calories (especially from fat and sugar) and to instead opt for whole foods as much as possible.

When I finally decided to experiment with virtually full-time vegetarianism in May 2012, I kept quiet about it—because having grown up in the heart of the Midwest, eating meat at least two and often three times a day, I had serious doubts that I could stick with a meatless diet for even a week or two.

My husband, Andrew—who had cooked professionally at some of the best restaurants in Boston and New York City, and who bravely joined me in my experiment in meatless eating—typically did our grocery shopping and most of the cooking. I provided “help” by giving him a list of what not to buy: Junk foods. Soft drinks. White flour, white sugar, white rice. Anything with hydrogenated vegetable oil. Trans fats. GMOs. Every news report seemed to add a new no-no to the list.

Over time, my “what-not-to-buy” list got so long that he grumbled, “Maybe you could make a list of what you’d like me to buy.”

A light bulb went off. I realized that avoiding certain foods—whether meats or white foods—was only one part of the picture. I decided to start a list of the healthiest ingredients that would provide us with the biggest nutritional bang for the calorie—“superfoods” that we could easily enjoy at home: Black beans. Blueberries. Broccoli. Kale. Lemons. Quinoa. Spinach. Then I started researching compatible flavors and flavor affinities for each, for ease in creating dishes. Then dish ideas themselves were added, often inspired by my research on the cookbooks, restaurants, and signature dishes of America’s best vegetarian and vegan chefs, dozens of whom I eventually interviewed. Although I started without any intention other than eating healthier at home, the project eventually evolved into this book and the lists you’ll find in Chapter 3.

Months later, we were both surprised to find that we didn’t miss meat at all. Instead, we were thrilled by all of the new flavor discoveries we were making about an exciting new repertoire of ingredients. We also noticed that when dining out, others were showing more interest in the meatless dishes we were being served than we had in those they were served. Andrew and I have been eating 99 percent vegetarian ever since.

When I finally started to mention this to others, I was asked time and time again by well-meaning friends and colleagues what I’ve since learned is the Number One question asked of vegetarians and vegans: “But how do you get your protein?”

My desire to make certain that the vegetarian diet I was embracing was indeed healthful—and to have well-informed, intelligent answers to such questions—led me to earn a certificate in plant-based nutrition from Cornell in conjunction with the T. Colin Campbell Foundation. The certificate program was created by the author of The China Study, the most groundbreaking, far-reaching nutritional study ever published. This is the education that helped inform my subsequent research for this book, which addresses three primary questions: what to eat (and in what quantities), how to make it healthful, and how to make it so delicious that its meatlessness is completely beside the point!





PROTEIN: IT’S WHAT’S FOR DINNER (AND LUNCH AND BREAKFAST)—EVEN WHEN YOU’RE EATING PLANTS


Here’s a typical conversation I’ve had after admitting to eating vegetarian, a version of which I first wrote as a class assignment for Cornell:

“Hey, Karen—did I hear you’re a vegetarian now? How are you getting enough protein if you’re not eating meat anymore? You don’t seem like the tofu and ‘wheat meat’ type!”

“Hi, Pat—actually, I’ve had some really delicious dishes made with tofu and seitan and even tempeh, but I don’t eat them very often. I probably get my protein from many of the same foods you do.”

“You mean you’re sneaking a cheeseburger here and there?”

“No, I mean I ran into you at the bagel place around the corner the other morning. A medium-sized bagel contains 10 grams of protein.”

“No kidding—I thought I was carbo-loading then!”

“Well, you got protein along with your carbs. I had my bagel that morning with a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter, which added another 8 grams of protein. And that night for dinner, Andrew made pasta primavera—with 8 grams of protein from the cup of pasta and another 9 grams of protein from the cup each of broccoli and spinach he added. It was delicious!”

“Guess I thought you had to eat meat to get protein. What other foods have it?”

“Lots of plant-based whole foods have protein, including legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas—and chickpeas, which I know you like because I saw you eating that hummus wrap the other week. Plus whole grains, nuts, and seeds.… The list is long.”

“And you get as much protein from them as you would from a cheeseburger?”

“You can easily get enough protein from a balanced plant-based diet—but with a lot less fat. And because of the health risks—including cancer and heart disease—you definitely don’t want to be eating too much protein.”

“Wow—I didn’t know.… I thought protein was good for you.”

“It is—it’s essential. But many people are unaware that it can actually be very risky to eat too much animal protein—which might just explain why there are so many sick people in the U.S., despite the fact that we spend more on healthcare than any other country.”





MAKING IT HEALTHFUL


“Let food be thy medicine.”

—HIPPOCRATES



Hippocrates was right. Each of us can play a role in solving our nation’s health crisis by taking the responsibility for choosing and administering our own “medicine,” an average of three times a day. As many doctors receive little or no training in nutrition, it’s up to each of us to learn the basics so we can eat to keep ourselves in good health and our immune systems strong. Happily, more Americans are finally understanding the health risks posed by animal protein and are reducing or eliminating it from their diets. Per capita meat consumption in the U.S. has fallen for the last five years and is forecasted to keep falling.

However, even when following a vegetarian diet, what you eat is just as important as what you don’t eat. After all, a soy burger on a white bun with corn chips and a soft drink may not contain meat, but few would argue that it’s a healthful meal.

On a visit several years ago to one of the top-rated vegetarian restaurants in the New York City Zagat Survey, I was struck by how many dishes were deep-fried and how “heavy” I felt afterward. The lesson hit home that it’s also important to favor dishes made via water-based cooking techniques (e.g., boiling, poaching, steaming) over fat-based cooking techniques (e.g., deep-fat frying, sautéing).

In addition, you’ll want to make sure your diet emphasizes foods that are the most nutritionally dense, delivering the most nutrients for the fewest calories. Dr. Joel Fuhrman, the bestselling author of Eat to Live, has developed a useful system called ANDI (Aggregate Nutrient Density Index), which Whole Foods shoppers might already be familiar with, as it’s used throughout the stores. Various foods are rated for nutrient content on a scale of 0–1000, so you can minimize foods at the lower end of the scale (e.g., cola and corn chips, which score a 1 and a 7, respectively) and seek out those at the higher end of the scale (e.g., greens such as collard, kale, and watercress, all of which score a perfect 1000). Other systems such as Dr. David Katz’s NuVal (featured at grocers like Kroger and Lowes) similarly score foods based on their nutrition. In Chapter 3, you’ll find many foods color-coded to help you find those that are more nutritionally dense (i.e., those with dark green triangles) and exercise judgment when it comes to others (i.e., those red triangles). As a rule of thumb,


Most green vegetables (and many herbs and spices)

Most nongreen vegetables, fresh fruits, and legumes

Most dried or sweeter fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds

Most dairy products (e.g., cheese, full-fat milk and yogurt)

Most oils and sweeteners

But opting for kale 100 percent of the time to fulfill your vegetable quotient doesn’t make for a healthful diet, either, despite its status as a nutritional powerhouse. You need vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that can come only from eating a wide variety of vegetables. My own strategy is to eat “in a different country” most days of the week, which presents me with a broad range of vegetables over the course of a week or two. For example:


Chinese: bok choy, broccoli, eggplant, long beans, mushrooms, snow peas

Ethiopian: beets, collard greens, green beans, lentils, onions

French: carrots, celery root, eggplant, French lentils, leeks, onions

Greek: chickpeas, eggplant, gigante beans, romaine lettuce, spinach

Indian: cauliflower, chickpeas, eggplant, jackfruit, lentils, spinach

Italian: arugula, broccoli rabe, tomatoes, white beans, zucchini

Japanese: edamame, mushrooms, sea vegetables (e.g., kelp, wakame), spinach

Mexican: avocados, beans, chayote, chiles, corn, tomatillos, tomatoes

Moroccan: cabbage, carrots, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, turnips, zucchini

Spanish: green or white asparagus, piquillo peppers, potatoes

Thai: bamboo shoots, bell peppers, eggplant, green beans, onions

Vietnamese: cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, mushrooms, taro, watercress

Variety is just as important when it comes to the rest of your diet—namely, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds—which helps to ensure you’re taking in the variety of nutrients your body needs. Dr. Fuhrman even came up with the useful acronym “G-BOMBS” as a reminder of the most nutritionally dense foods he believes should be a part of a healthful daily diet: greens, beans, onions, mushrooms, berries, and seeds, which he has found to be “extremely effective at preventing chronic disease and promoting health and longevity.”

I love rules of thumb because they’re straightforward and useful. One of the easiest to remember is Michael Pollan’s seven-word mantra: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” By advising us to “eat food,” Pollan refers to whole foods—meaning we should avoid processed foods. “Mostly plants” means we should make sure that the majority of our diet consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and whole-grain products, legumes, nuts, and seeds. And “not too much” warns against overconsuming food in such quantities that we become overweight or obese and put ourselves at greater risk of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes.

ChooseMyPlate.gov offers “Tips for Vegetarians,” suggesting that they may need to give special attention to their intake of “protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.” I address the (non-)issue of getting sufficient nutrients such as protein and calcium later in this chapter, but it’s worth covering the others here briefly. Vegetarians who eat eggs and/or dairy shouldn’t have a problem getting enough vitamin B12. Vegans sometimes sprinkle cheesy-tasting nutritional yeast (a great source of B12) on their popcorn and tofu scrambles or take B12 supplements.

However, both iron (in beans, black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, broccoli, chard, chickpeas, collard greens, lentils, spinach, tempeh, tofu) and zinc (in almonds, beans, cashews, chickpeas, green peas, oatmeal, pumpkin seeds, wheat germ) are readily available via plant-based sources. Since I started to eat vegetarian, my blood tests haven’t indicated any nutritional deficiencies; in addition, my hair and skin (which now feel amazingly moisturized from the inside out) both have a new glow, and perhaps most tellingly, I feel better than ever.

A nutrient-rich, whole-food plant-based diet is the answer to so many health concerns—from protecting our bones, brains, eyes, hearts, and kidneys, to preventing or sometimes even reversing autoimmune diseases, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and more. And if you’re seeking any additional reasons to consider a vegetarian or even vegan diet, you’re likely to find them in Chapter 1.





WHAT TO EAT (AND HOW MUCH)


“Vegetarian diets can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs.”

—CHOOSEMYPLATE.GOV, “TIPS FOR VEGETARIANS”




“Go with plants. Eating a plant-based diet is healthiest. Make your plate vegetables and fruits (potatoes and French fries don’t count as vegetables).… Get most or all of your protein from beans, nuts and seeds, or tofu.”

—THE NUTRITION SOURCE, HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (HSPH.HARVARD.EDU)



Food is composed of one or more of three macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All three are essential to a healthful diet, so you’ll want to choose foods that provide you with sufficient quantities of each—but not too much of any, especially protein and fat, which correlate with increased rates of disease when they are overconsumed. But what is the right proportion? Based on all I’ve learned, I’ll give a short answer and a long answer.



The Short Answer: A healthful meatless diet consists primarily of roughly equal proportions of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains (accented by nuts and seeds). If you picture yourself filling your plate with some of each at every meal, making sure to eat a wide variety of whole, unprocessed foods from every category over the course of every week (to ensure that you’re getting a variety of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients), and not overeating (i.e., not consuming too many calories, particularly from protein or fat), generally speaking, you don’t need to worry about counting calories, grams of protein, or anything else.


The Long Answer: Opinions differ on exactly what proportions of total calories you should get from each macronutrient. For benchmarks, I’ll share what the U.S. government recommends via its 2010 ChooseMyPlate.gov program—which many have argued overemphasizes meat and dairy as a result of those industries’ enormous economic and political clout—and contrast that with recommendations from other respected sources such as The China Study. Each of us needs to decide for ourselves what to eat, and those decisions are, ideally, well informed and appropriate to our personal circumstances (e.g., younger and healthy, versus older and trying to reverse heart disease). For what it’s worth, I’ll also share what I personally choose to eat, based on what I’ve learned.





PROTEIN


The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that 10 to 35 percent of total daily calories come from protein.

However, in The China Study, T. Colin Campbell recommends that less than 10 percent of total daily calories come from healthful protein (sufficient to meet the body’s need for 5 to 6 percent dietary protein to replace that which the body regularly excretes, yet insufficient to trigger the onset of disease), which translates into just 50 to 60 grams of protein per day. The average American typically consumes 70 to 100 grams per day, primarily from animal-based sources (e.g., meats, poultry, seafood), a level of overconsumption that correlates with a higher risk of diseases such as heart disease and certain cancers. Because 50 to 60 grams of protein a day can easily be provided by a plant-based diet, The China Study recommends avoiding meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy.


“Dietary protein within the range of 10–20 percent is associated with a broad array of health problems [e.g., higher blood cholesterol levels, higher risks of atherosclerosis, cancer, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and kidney stones], especially when most of the protein is from animal sources.”

—T. COLIN CAMPBELL, THE CHINA STUDY





PROTEIN FOODS


ChooseMyPlate.gov recommends 5 to 6½ ounces or “ounce equivalents” of protein per day for adults.


What counts? A wide variety of vegetarian foods provide protein.


Sample choices: beans (e.g., black, kidney, navy, pinto, white), eggs (e.g., frittatas, omelets), falafel, legumes (e.g., black-eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, split peas), nuts and nut butters (e.g., almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts), seeds (e.g., chia, hemp, pumpkin, sesame, sunflower), seitan, soups (e.g., bean, lentil, split pea), soybeans and soy products, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein (TVP), tofu, vegetarian chili made with beans, some veggie burgers (e.g., those made with beans or other legumes or soy), not to mention many other foods that contain protein (e.g., grains, such as kamut and quinoa; or vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale, spinach, and watercress, as more than 40 percent of their calories are from protein).

One “ounce equivalent” is about ¼ cup cooked beans, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, or ½ ounce of nuts or seeds. Or, if you’d rather count grams of protein to make sure you’re not getting too much, here are some examples of the number of grams of protein in common servings:

1 large egg = 6 grams

½ cup black beans = 7.5 grams

½ cup black-eyed peas = 6.5 grams

½ cup chickpeas = 7.5 grams

½ cup lentils = 9 grams

1 ounce almonds = 6 grams

1 ounce peanut butter = 7 grams

1 ounce tempeh = 5 grams

¼ cup firm (raw) tofu = 10 grams

1 Burger King veggie burger = 14 grams

1 Shake Shack ’Shroom (vegetarian) burger = 18 grams



Don’t forget that vegetarian protein sources also include vegetables and grains! Here are a few examples of other foods with protein content:

1 medium artichoke = 3 grams

1 cup asparagus = 4 grams

1 cup pureed avocado = 5 grams

½ large bagel = 7 grams

1 cup broccoli = 4 grams

1 cup Brussels sprouts = 4 grams

1 medium potato = 5 grams

½ cup quinoa = 4 grams

1 cup spinach = 5 grams

½ cup sun-dried tomatoes = 4 grams



By the way, contrary to popular belief, the idea that you have to combine certain proteins (e.g., beans and rice) at the same meal has been disproven. Given reports of the myth’s persistence as of this writing, this finding seems to bear repeating.


“Protein is found in most plant foods as well as animal foods. Your body will make its own complete protein if a variety of foods and enough calories are eaten during the day.”

—ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS (EATRIGHT.ORG)



T. Colin Campbell, author of The China Study, recommends that you avoid meat, poultry, dairy, and eggs; eat all you want (while getting lots of variety) of any whole, unrefined plant-based foods (e.g., legumes, nuts, etc.).


Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, author of the bestselling book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, recommends “not eating anything with a mother or a face (no meat, poultry, or fish).”


What I do: I aim to consume less than 10 percent of my total calories from protein—and to get the protein from plants. A few tips: I typically eat one half-cup to one cup of legumes daily. For breakfast, I sometimes spread peanut butter on apple slices or whole-grain toast or make a tofu scramble. I love adding beans or chickpeas to soups and even green or grain salads, and low-fat hummus is one food you’ll always find in our refrigerator. For Chinese or Thai meals, I add cubes of tofu to brown rice dishes and curries.





Know Your Nutrition


If you’d like to analyze the nutritional content of various foods, visit the USDA’s National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference at ndb.nal.usda.gov or the more user-friendly site based on its data at nutritiondata.self.com.

To analyze the nutritional content of a recipe or your diet, visit a website such as caloriecount.about.com, which also provides “Nutrition Grades” for specific foods.





CARBOHYDRATES


The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that 45 to 65 percent of total daily calories come from carbohydrates.


Dr. Campbell recommends that at least 80 percent of total daily calories come from healthful carbohydrates.


The primary sources of carbohydrates are vegetables, fruits, grains/cereals, and legumes. Legumes (primarily peas and beans) are also a significant source of protein, so vegetarians can count them as either carbohydrates (vegetables) or protein.


“The USDA Food Patterns classify beans and peas as a subgroup of the Vegetable Group. The USDA Food Patterns also indicate that beans and peas may be counted as part of the Protein Foods Group. Individuals can count beans and peas as either a vegetable or a protein food. Green peas, green lima beans, and green (string) beans are not considered to be part of the beans and peas subgroup. Green peas and green lima beans are similar to other starchy vegetables and are grouped with them. Green beans are grouped with other vegetables such as onions, lettuce, celery, and cabbage because their nutrient content is similar to those foods.”

—CHOOSEMYPLATE.GOV





VEGETABLES


ChooseMyPlate.gov recommends 2 to 3 cups daily for adults.


What counts? Whole, cut, or mashed vegetables (fresh, frozen, dehydrated, or canned, served either raw or cooked), or 100 percent vegetable juice.


Sample choices: A variety from among the five sub-groups of vegetables, each of which provides a different mix of nutrients.

Dark green: beet greens, bok choy, broccoli, chard, collard greens, dark green lettuce, endive, escarole, kale, mustard greens, romaine, spinach, turnip greens, watercress

Red and orange: acorn squash, butternut squash, carrots, Hubbard squash, pumpkin, red bell peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and tomato juice

Starchy: black-eyed peas, corn, green peas, green plantains, Jerusalem artichokes, lima beans, parsnips, plantains, potatoes, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, taro, water chestnuts, winter squash, yams (Note that starchy vegetables, which are calorically dense, should be eaten in moderation, especially by those seeking to lose weight.)

Peas and beans: black beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils, navy beans, pinto beans, soybeans, split peas, white beans (These also contain significant amounts of protein.)

Other: artichokes, asparagus, avocados, beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumbers, eggplant, green beans, green bell peppers, iceberg lettuce, mushrooms, okra, onions, sea vegetables, sprouts (e.g., bean), summer squash, turnips, zucchini



Dr. Campbell recommends that you eat all you want, while getting lots of variety, of any whole, unrefined plant-based food such as vegetables.


What I do: I eat as many vegetables as possible every day—about half raw (e.g., in salads, or in juices and smoothies) and half cooked. I shoot for two or three green leafy vegetables, and one or two cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) among them. Tips: I eat a salad with lots of raw veggies at lunch and/or dinner. I also try to eat one or two vegetables at every meal (e.g., a banana-and-kale smoothie, a veggie omelet, or veggie-tofu scramble at breakfast; a vegetable-based soup at lunch or dinner, as well as vegetables in a main course, such as a burrito, farrotto/risotto, noodle or rice bowl, pasta, pizza, stir-fry, etc.). Knowing the importance of having two or three green leafy vegetables (e.g., collard greens, kale, spinach) every day, I’ve discovered that a glass of green juice gives me a great natural pick-me-up—better than caffeine!—so I’ve traded in my former 4:00 p.m. coffee break for an afternoon green juice break.





FRUITS


ChooseMyPlate.gov recommends 1½ to 2 cups daily for adults.


What counts? Whole, cut, or pureed fruit, or 100 percent fruit juice (e.g., apple, grape, grapefruit, orange). Because of its concentration of nutrients and fiber, a half-cup of dried fruit, such as prunes or raisins, counts as a one-cup serving.


Sample choices: apples and applesauce, apricots, bananas, berries (e.g., blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries), cherries, citrus fruits (e.g., grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges), grapes, kiwis, mangoes, melons (e.g., cantaloupes, honeydews, watermelons), nectarines, peaches, pears, papayas, pineapples, plums, tangerines


Dr. Campbell recommends eating all you want, while getting lots of variety, of any whole, unrefined plant-based food such as fruits.


What I do: I aim for an average of three servings of raw, fresh fruit daily. Tips: I have fruit on top of my morning oatmeal, as part of a fruit or green salad, or in a smoothie. I love freezing bananas and putting them through a Champion juicer for a softserve-like dessert.





GRAINS / CEREALS


ChooseMyPlate.gov recommends 5–8 ounces or “ounce equivalents” daily for adults, with more than 50 percent coming from whole grains.


What counts? Whole-grain foods include breads, cereals such as granola or muesli, crackers, pastas, tortillas, etc., made from whole grains or whole “pseudograins” (which are not technically grains but are commonly grouped with them), e.g., amaranth, barley, brown rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn and whole-grain cornmeal, farro, kamut, kasha, millet, oats (including rolled oats and oatmeal), popcorn, quinoa, rice, rye berries, sorghum, spelt, teff, triticale, wheat berries, wild rice, or another cereal grain.


Sample choices: One “ounce equivalent” is about ¼ large bagel, 1 slice of bread, ½ English muffin, ½ cup cooked grain (e.g., bulgur, oats), pasta, or rice; 2 three-inch pancakes, 3 cups of popcorn, 1 cup of prepared cereal, or 1 six-inch tortilla.


Dr. Campbell recommends eating all you want, while getting lots of variety, of any whole, unrefined plant-based foods such as whole grains (e.g., in breads, pastas, etc.).


What I do: I limit my grains to three to five servings daily. Tips: I sometimes make myself oatmeal or another whole grain as a hot breakfast cereal and have a sandwich on a slice or two of whole-grain bread or pita for lunch, while dinner sometimes revolves around brown rice or another whole grain (e.g., farro, wheat berries) served risotto-style, whole-grain pasta or pizza dough, or whole-grain tortillas. Most of the time, I try to avoid refined grains (i.e., white rice or anything made from white flour, including white bread) altogether, and to opt for whole-grain versions of rice noodles, cornbread, corn tortillas, and couscous.





FAT


The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that 20 to 35 percent of total daily calories come from fat.


Dr. Campbell recommends that less than 10 percent of total daily calories come from fat.





OILS / FATS


ChooseMyPlate.gov suggests an allowance of 5 to 7 teaspoons of oils daily for adults. One teaspoon of any oil or fat contains 40 calories. ChooseMyPlate.gov indicates that no added fats may be necessary, given that “some Americans consume enough oil in the foods they eat, such as nuts, [fish,] cooking oil, and salad dressings.” The Standard American Diet (SAD) is close to 40 percent fat, so for many people, achieving a healthier target requires a dramatic lifestyle change—such as not making or ordering fried dishes, omitting the oil from stir-fries, or not slathering butter or oil on breads.


What counts? oils and oily foods (Note that solid fats—fats that are solid at room temperature, such as butter, margarine, and milk fat, along with coconut oil and palm oil—should be minimized or avoided in vegetarian diets aiming to lower cholesterol levels.)


Sample choices: oils (e.g., canola; corn; hazelnut; olive and other plant-based, organic, expeller-pressed, high-oleic oils; safflower; sesame; soybean; sunflower; walnut) and oily foods such as avocados, mayonnaise, nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, peanuts, walnuts) and nut butters, olives, seeds (e.g., flax, hemp, pumpkin, sesame, sunflower), some salad dressings


Dr. Campbell recommends minimizing added vegetable oils (e.g., corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil).


Dr. Esselstyn famously recommends “NO OIL!” at all. Zero. No avocados or nuts, either.


What I do: I avoid adding much, if any, oil to my diet (e.g., by cooking in vegetable stock instead of oil). I do sometimes add a little olive oil to certain salad dressings, but in less than the standard 1:3 ratio. Tips: Eat something every day for healthful omega-3 fats (e.g., canola oil, flaxseeds in smoothies, walnuts in granola or oatmeal). And I do love avocados as guacamole, added to salads, or whipped into salad dressings.





DAIRY


(Note: Whole milk is 50 percent fat, 30 percent carbs, and 20 percent protein, while cheese is 75 percent fat and 25 percent protein—which is why this food group is listed here. Note, however, that dairy is not listed as a fat at ChooseMyPlate.gov.)


ChooseMyPlate.gov recommends 3 cups or “cup equivalents” daily for adults, especially fat-free or low-fat options.


What counts? cheese, cream and ice cream, milk and ice milk, (calcium-fortified) soy milk, yogurt and frozen yogurt. (You’ll also want to count foods like cream-based soups, milk-based coffee drinks, and yogurt-based dips or smoothies.)


Sample choices: One “cup equivalent” is about 2 cups cottage cheese, 1½ ounces hard cheese, 1½ cups ice cream, 1 cup milk or calcium-fortified soy milk, 1 cup milk-based pudding, ½ cup ricotta cheese, ⅓ cup shredded cheese, or 1 cup yogurt.


Dr. Campbell recommends avoiding dairy.


Dr. Esselstyn recommends avoiding dairy.


What I do: I am lactose intolerant. It’s a trait I happen to share with 75 percent of the world’s population, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which also points out that the lot of us are starting to be referred to as “normal” and those who are able to digest lactose as “lactose persistent.” I avoid milk, cream, and other dairy—and gag at the thought of ever trying to consume ChooseMyPlate’s recommended 3 cups a day! I find some cheeses and yogurts somewhat easier to digest, but—given some indication of a correlation between high levels of full-fat dairy consumption and certain diseases such as breast cancer—I eat them only very rarely, such as to garnish pasta (e.g., Parmesan), Greek food (e.g., tzatziki), or Indian food (e.g., raita). Tips: I gave up my former daily cappuccino habit more than a decade ago, and I’ve happily switched to almond milk with my morning oatmeal or granola and love the way it enhances the flavor of both.

ChooseMyPlate.gov emphasizes that foods in the dairy group “provide nutrients that are vital for health and maintenance of your body,” including protein (see above), calcium, potassium, and vitamin D. However, those of us who choose to largely or entirely avoid dairy can healthfully turn to other options for these nutrients:

Calcium: beans (e.g., black, kidney, navy, pinto, white), black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, bok choy, broccoli, chickpeas, dark leafy greens (e.g., collard, mustard, turnip), fortified soy milk, kale, nuts and nut butters (e.g., almonds), sesame seeds and sesame paste, spinach, tempeh, tofu that is processed with calcium sulfate

Potassium: avocados, beans (e.g., kidney, lima, pinto), chard, fruits (especially bananas) and fruit juices, lentils, papayas, potatoes, spinach

Vitamin D: egg yolks, mushrooms (e.g., portobellos, shiitakes), or vitamin D–fortified foods such as cereals, juices, and milks (both dairy and nondairy)—or simply spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sunshine every day or two, and your body will make its own vitamin D. If it’s cloudy or you can’t be outdoors enough, consider taking a supplement.



By the way, on the question of what to drink as a beverage instead of milk, I’ll share that I typically drink hot tea at breakfast, water or iced tea at lunch (I’m particularly fond of caffeine-free SPORTea, which I was first introduced to at the Lodge at Woodloch in Pennsylvania), and one glass of wine at dinner (per the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which allow two glasses of wine for men).





MAKING IT DELICIOUS


“I believe the future is vegetables and fruits. They are so much sexier than a piece of chicken.… You get a piece of meat and you put it in your mouth, you chew, the first five seconds, all the juices flow around your mouth, they’re gone, and then you are twenty more seconds chewing something that is tasteless at this point. Something like this doesn’t happen with a pineapple, an asparagus, or a green pea.”

—CHEF JOSÉ ANDRÉS, IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER ON 60 MINUTES (APRIL 27, 2010)



Once you’ve committed to enjoying a whole foods, plant-based diet, this is where the real fun begins.

In Chapter 2, you’ll find insights from some of the country’s leading chefs on how to do so deliciously. In Chapter 3, you’ll find a comprehensive A-to-Z list of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and other ingredients, along with the herbs, spices, and other seasonings that best enhance their flavor—not to mention the techniques that best showcase their texture and flavor. You’ll also find tips from leading chefs on how they work with these ingredients and how the ingredients are combined into signature dishes.

My pursuit of deliciousness never went away—it’s merely changed direction over the past few years. If I hadn’t discovered eating vegetarian to be so delicious, I’d never have lasted beyond that first meatless week. But as I’ve learned through the vegetarian and even vegan anniversary and birthday meals we’ve enjoyed at Blue Hill, DANIEL, Eleven Madison Park, the Inn at Little Washington, Mélisse, Per Se, Picholine, Zaytinya, and elsewhere—not to mention at America’s diverse range of impressive vegetarian and vegan restaurants, which have been a revelation to experience, as well as ethnic and other vegetable-centric restaurants—eating this way offers the thrill of discovery of new avenues of flavor. In the pages that follow, I’m happy to share with you all I’ve had the pleasure of learning over the past several years, and I am confident you’ll be as happy as I’ve been to find that this way of eating can be even more satisfying and delicious than you ever dreamed possible. Best of all, armed with this book, you’ll be on the front line of creating new dishes and a whole new way of eating that’s as healthful for others and for the planet as it is for you.





FOR THE LOVE OF PLANTS:

VEGETARIANISM THROUGH THE AGES



“The gods created certain kinds of beings to replenish our bodies… the trees and the plants and the seeds.”

—PLATO




“I do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.”

—MOHANDAS GANDHI




“The average person doesn’t have a clue that the meat they’re eating is causing all this havoc. They don’t understand about the effects on the environment or on human cells. The suffering of the animals they might try to turn away from. So how to make them listen and understand is difficult, but it’s happening.”

—JANE GOODALL



For the first time in history, interest in vegetarianism is on its way to becoming mainstream. After being embraced by countless people over millennia, it is still not typical—with just 5 percent of American adults self-identifying as vegetarian (abstaining from all meat), and another 2 percent as vegan (abstaining from all meat, eggs, and dairy), according to a July 2012 Gallup poll—although these numbers are growing. However, when they are added to the more than 47 percent of adult Americans who acknowledge a wish to decrease their meat consumption (according to a 2011 USA Today report), one could argue that the desire to eat less or even no meat is finally becoming the norm. Four consecutive years of decline in U.S. meat consumption, from 2006 to 2010—the first on record—and USDA projections of further declines offer additional evidence that a profound shift is under way.

Eating vegetarian, and even vegan, is easier than ever before. The proliferation of dedicated vegetarian restaurants—from upscale Vedge in Philadelphia, which GQ named one of the best new restaurants of 2012, to fast-casual chains like Native Foods and Veggie Grill—not to mention vegetarian menu options everywhere from Chipotle and Subway to DANIEL and the French Laundry to countless independent Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and other ethnic restaurants, makes vegetarian dining a no-brainer. At the same time, the rapid growth in farmers’ markets, CSAs, and vegetarian cookbooks and media have been a boon to home cooks. Even veganism is less challenging, as evidenced by more widespread availability of nondairy milks (which saw U.S. sales topping $1.4 billion in 2013), nondairy butters (e.g., Earth Balance) and nondairy cheeses (e.g., Daiya), as well as eggless mayonnaises (e.g., Vegenaise).

No longer exclusively the domain of countercultural “hippies,” vegetarianism and veganism are, well, hip, thanks to their endorsement by some of the most influential people of this era. Television personalities such as Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey and popular entertainers including Kristen Bell, Russell Brand, Alan Cumming, Woody Harrelson, Anne Hathaway, Chrissie Hynde, Joan Jett, Jared Leto, Adam Levine, Jennifer Lopez, Tobey Maguire, Lea Michele, Morrissey, Natalie Portman, Prince, Alicia Silverstone, Carrie Underwood, and Forest Whitaker have thrust meatless diets into the media spotlight and helped to keep them there. Even BusinessWeek has profiled industry leaders who eschew meat, including Twitter cofounder Biz Stone and hotelier Steve Wynn, and perhaps most notably former President Bill Clinton, who lost 24 pounds after 2004 quadruple bypass surgery and 2010 stent surgery by switching to a vegan diet.

Vegetarianism has been around for as long as human beings themselves, and compelling arguments for abstaining from meat are numerous and timeless. A glance through history shows the various cultural, economic, environmental, ethical, global, medical, nutritional, patriotic, practical, religious, and other factors that have given rise to vegetarianism. On the heels of the teachings of world religions and Greek and Roman philosophers, an impressive number of history’s greatest geniuses—including da Vinci, Einstein, and Gandhi—lived some or all of their adult lives as vegetarians.

The advent of nutritional science in the twentieth century has established the relationship between diet and health, as well as demonstrated a correlation between consuming too much animal protein and many chronic diseases, including heart disease, certain cancers, and obesity. Groundbreaking studies republished in bestselling books like The China Study, reinforced by other efforts such as the popular “Meatless Monday” campaign, have helped make common knowledge out of this information. Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney famously quipped, “If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be vegetarian.” Indeed, the Internet and YouTube have put just a click away horrifying video images of some of what goes on in the factory farms that supply 99 percent of the meat, eggs, and dairy products consumed in the United States, providing virtual “glass walls” that have been fueling the growing animal welfare movement. And facts, figures, and photos of what eating animals is doing to our most precious natural resources—our air, land, and water—make the reality too hard to ignore, leading even billionaire Bill Gates, who’s investing in companies developing vegan meat and egg replacements, to advocate a move toward vegetarianism as a way to save the planet and avoid the looming global food shortage crisis.

With such powerful champions and arguments, why isn’t everyone vegetarian yet? There are also powerful cultural, economic, and political forces underlying American society and its meat- and dairy-centric status quo. Turn on the TV, and you’ll find a seemingly endless stream of ads promoting meaty, cheesy fast food, followed by another endless stream of ads for pharmaceuticals that promise relief from the ailments often correlated with overconsuming such products.

Government policy is arguably more supportive of big business that contributes mightily to the U.S. economy than of the health of its individual citizens (especially our children, whose obesity-driven diabetes epidemic is leading to tragic predictions of shorter lifespans). Commodity products like corn and soybeans that are fed to livestock are subsidized with taxpayer dollars, as are the meat and dairy industries themselves, which in 2011 benefited directly or indirectly from 63 percent of government agricultural subsidies, while fruit and vegetable producers received less than 1 percent. Over the past fifty years, those representing the interests of the meat and dairy industries have sometimes been the ones setting our country’s nutritional policy guidelines (as a 2000 court ruling determined), despite the obvious conflicts of interest.

But it’s becoming clearer every day that moving toward vegetarianism is better for your health, better for the health of other living beings, and better for the planet as a whole. While you don’t have to be a full-time vegetarian to reap the benefits, I hope that you’ll discover—as I have—that eating vegetarian is so delicious and makes you feel so much better, lighter, and more energetic, that you’ll opt to maximize these benefits by eliminating as much meat as you choose. And I do believe it’s important to emphasize that what you choose to eat is a personal decision—one best made by fully understanding how eating animals affects your personal health and well-being, that of your family and others, and that of our planet.


“If anyone wants to save the planet, all they have to do is stop eating meat.”

—SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY



Choosing to not eat meat, or even to eat less of it, is a simple yet powerful way to be a part of the solution to some of the most pressing problems of today and tomorrow. Think of vegetarianism as presenting a spectrum of choices:



Fully 93 percent of the population does not self-identify as wholly vegetarian or vegan. Bestselling author Dr. John McDougall counts himself among that majority, even though he has espoused the health benefits of a low-fat vegan diet for decades while eating a 99+ percent meatless diet himself. He explains, “I do not want to be thought of as a vegetarian because so many people who call themselves vegetarians are unhealthy,” citing a soy burger, French fries, and Coca-Cola as a vegetarian meal. I also count myself among that 93 percent, even though I have eaten a 99+ percent meatless diet since May 2012. I believe labels can be divisive, emphasizing differences rather than bringing people together—and bringing people together can be one of food’s greatest benefits and pleasures.

Clearly, nonvegetarians fall along a broad spectrum representing a wide range of diets. Omnivores (people who eat everything, both animals and plants) can choose to limit the amount of meat they eat, making them “semi-vegetarians” or “flexitarians.” Some eat no meat other than fish and are called “pescetarians.” “Vegetarian” typically describes those who abstain from meat (including red meat, poultry, and seafood). “Lacto-vegetarians” are vegetarians who also abstain from eggs but not dairy, while “ovo-vegetarians” are vegetarians who abstain from dairy but not eggs. “Vegan” is used to describe vegetarians who abstain from both dairy and eggs (and, depending on one’s personal definition, often other animal-derived products, such as gelatin and honey). As McDougall suggests, a healthful vegetarian or even vegan diet is about what you choose to eat as much as what you choose not to eat, which is why a “whole-food, plant-based diet” has become the catchphrase for this healthful approach to eating.

Ultimately, the decisions each of us makes throughout the day give us the opportunity to create the future of food—and the world—by voting with our forks. The 1960s taught us that “the personal is political” and that how we choose to live our lives is our statement of who we are. “We are what we eat” sums this up succinctly. Believing the dictum that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,” this book begins with a broad-brush overview of the roots of vegetarianism and our fast-growing enjoyment of a plant-based diet, by way of a timeline highlighting some of the key influencers and organizations, classic books, notable events, and other milestones that have influenced this shift.





SOME NOTABLE EVENTS IN VEGETARIAN HISTORY


YEAR: ~3000–2000 BCE

EVENT: One of the world’s most ancient religions, Hinduism, teaches that humans should not inflict pain on other animals, leading to the peaceful and compassionate practice (or sadhana, which means “spiritual practice”) of vegetarianism.



“You must not use your God-given body for killing God’s creatures, whether they be human, animals, or whatever.”

—YAJUR VEDA (12.32), SACRED HINDU TEXT



YEAR: ~500s BCE

EVENT: Chinese sage Lao Tzu (c. 604–531 BCE) writes the classic Chinese text Tao Te Ching, which gives rise to Taoism, one of the three primary religions of China (along with Buddhism and Confucianism), which calls for doing no harm to any other life form.

YEAR: ~500s BCE

EVENT: Greek philosopher Pythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE), the man whose theorem a2 + b2 = c2 rocked the field of geometry, leads what is thought to be the first community requiring a vegetarian diet and is described in Ovid’s Metamorphoses as “the first to censure man for eating the flesh of animals.” People who abstained from eating meat were often called “Pythagoreans” before the term “vegetarian” was coined in the late nineteenth century.



“Animals share with us the privilege of having a soul.”

—PYTHAGORAS



“Mortals, refrain from defiling your bodies with sinful feasting, for you have the fruits of the earth and of arbors, whose branches bow with their burden; for you the grapes ripen, for you the delicious greens are made tender by cooking; milk is permitted to you too, and thyme-scented honey: Earth is abundantly wealthy and freely provides you her gentle sustenance, offered without any bloodshed.”

—THE CHARACTER OF PYTHAGORAS, IN OVID’S IN METAMORPHOSES, BOOK XV (8 CE)



YEAR: ~500s BCE

EVENT: After forty-nine days of meditation, Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563–483 BCE) achieves enlightenment, becoming the Buddha and inspiring Buddhism, which forbids harming any living creature, and millions of Buddhist followers who practice vegetarianism. He encourages his followers to eat spinach.



“The eating of meat extinguishes the seed of great compassion.”

—BUDDHA



YEAR: ~500s BCE

EVENT: Prince Vardhamana (Nigantha Nataputta), or Mahavira (c. 540–510 BCE), founds Jainism, one of India’s primary religions, which values animal rights and forbids the taking of life (whether an insect or a root vegetable). Vegetarianism is mandatory for followers.

YEAR: ~400s BCE

EVENT: In The Laws, Greek philosopher Plato (429–347 BCE) notes the relationship between one’s diet and one’s conduct. In The Republic, the character Socrates asserts that the ideal city would be vegetarian, saying that meat is a luxury that leads to decadence and war. He also questions the excessive amount of land needed to raise cattle.

YEAR: 8 CE

EVENT: The Roman poet Ovid (c. 43 BCE–17 CE) writes Metamorphoses, which includes a speech in the voice of Pythagoras, urging abstinence from eating meat and the abandonment of animal sacrifice.

YEAR: ~100 CE

EVENT: Greek philosopher Plutarch (c. 46–120 CE), a vegetarian, writes a number of pro-vegetarian essays, including On the Eating of Flesh. In the nineteenth century, the Oxford graduate and Romantic poet Percy Shelley (1792–1822) will translate them into English and become a vegetarian himself.

“For what sort of dinner is not costly, for which a living creature loses its life?”

—PLUTARCH



YEAR: ~200s CE

EVENT: The Greek philosopher Porphyry (233–304), a practicing vegetarian, revives interest in Plato’s philosophy.

YEAR: 1400s

EVENT: Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), widely considered history’s greatest genius, is one of the first important ethical vegetarians since ancient times to oppose meat-eating on humanitarian grounds. He is said to have frequently bought live birds for sale as food at the market in Florence just to set them free.



“You needn’t be a genius to be a vegetarian, but many geniuses—including Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Gandhi, and Nikola Tesla—endorsed vegetarianism.… Andrea Corsali, an Italian explorer, wrote a letter to his sponsor Giuliano de′ Medici in which he noted the meatless diet of the [Indian] Gujurati peoples he observed in his travels. Corsali writes that in addition to avoiding meat, they do not ‘permit among them any injury be done to any living thing,’ and then he adds, ‘like our Leonardo da Vinci.’ ”

—MICHAEL GELB, AUTHOR OF HOW TO THINK LIKE LEONARDO DA VINCI



YEAR: 1699

EVENT: John Evelyn (1620–1706) writes Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets, advocating the eating of salads and providing what’s been since called “the world’s first A–Z of salad ingredients,” classifying dozens of herbs by their appropriateness for cooking versus being served uncooked.

YEAR: 1732

EVENT: German settlers in Pennsylvania, led by Johann Conrad Beissel (1691–1768), create the Ephrata Cloister, which advocates vegetarianism as a path to spiritual goals and which by its dissolution in 1813 has become the longest-lived commune in America. The physical site is still open for daily tours.

YEAR: 1790s

EVENT: Massachusetts native John Chapman—better known as Johnny Appleseed (1774–1845)—begins his journey to sow apple seeds throughout the Midwest. A vegetarian follower of Christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, he is said to have subsisted mainly on foraged nuts and berries.



YEAR: 1809

EVENT: The Reverend William Cowherd (1763–1816), founds the Bible Christian Church (BCC) near Manchester, England, and advocates for abstinence from eating meat. The BCC is now credited as the forerunner of modern vegetarianism.

YEAR: 1813

EVENT: Inspired by Return to Nature, or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen by his friend John Frank Newton (1766–1837), Percy Shelley (1792–1822) makes the case for vegetarianism in his essay “A Vindication of Natural Diet,” which argues against the waste of both animal life and valuable land.

“The most fertile districts of the habitable globe are now actively cultivated by men for animals, at a delay and waste of aliment absolutely incapable of calculation.”

—PERCY SHELLEY



YEAR: 1817

EVENT: The Reverend William Metcalfe (1788–1862) and forty other pilgrims from Manchester’s Bible Christian Church (BCC) sail to America to establish the vegetarian sect in Pennsylvania.

YEAR: 1821

EVENT: Martha Brotherton—wife of Joseph, who was a preacher at the Bible Christian Church and a leader in the Vegetarian Society—writes one of the first vegetarian cookbooks, A New System of Vegetable Cookery.

YEAR: 1837

EVENT: The first American book dedicated to the subject of bread, A Treatise on Bread, and Bread-Making by Sylvester Graham (1794–1851) is published. He travels to preach the virtues of whole wheat bread (arguing that to separate the bran from the rest of the wheat berry was “against the will of God”) and vegetarianism, and is so persuasive that his followers become known as Grahamites. He is credited both with influencing New York Tribune founder Horace Greeley to become a vegetarian and with inspiring the creation of the whole wheat flour–based Graham cracker.

YEAR: 1837

EVENT: On March 7, in Boston, William Alcott and Sylvester Graham are among the founders of the American Physiological Society (APS). The organization’s constitution states that “the farinaceous vegetables” are “the best food for man.”

“The APS also moved meat abstention away from religious doctrinal structures and placed dietary reform firmly within the realm of scientific study.”

—ADAM D. SHPRINTZEN, IN THE VEGETARIAN CRUSADE (2013)



YEAR: 1838

EVENT: William Andrus Alcott (1798–1859) writes Vegetable Diet: As Sanctioned by Medical Men, and By Experience in All Ages. This popular book, one of the first American books to espouse a vegetarian diet, includes the chapter “A Vegetable Diet Defended,” which makes seven key arguments for vegetarianism: “1) The Anatomical Argument, 2) The Physiological Argument, 3) The Medical Argument, 4) The Political Argument, 5) The Economical Argument, 6) The Argument from Experience, 7) The Moral Argument.” Alcott advocates replacing meat-based breakfasts with grain-based dishes, such as brown bread (also known as Graham bread), boiled rice, or rye toast.

YEAR: 1838

EVENT: Alcott House, named after educational reformer Bronson Alcott, is established in England as a spiritual school embracing vegetarian principles. It thrives over the next several years, giving rise to the first Vegetarian Society in 1847.

“Asked to write a few words of introduction to Vegetable Diet, I sat down to read it, expecting to find quaint and cobwebby ideas. I found instead, from Alcott and his hundred or so contributors, including philosophers and poets, ideas that are at the heart of the discussion about food today, from academia to tabloid talk shows—comments on health, sustainability, ethics, and even the safety of the food supply.”

—ANNA THOMAS, AUTHOR OF THE VEGETARIAN EPICURE, IN HER INTRODUCTION TO THE 2012 EDITION OF WILLIAM ANDRUS ALCOTT’S 1838 VEGETABLE DIET



YEAR: 1842

EVENT: The word “vegetarian” is used in print for the first time (in The Healthian, a publication of Alcott House) to describe the consumption of only plants, in accordance with the common meaning of the word “vegetable” at that time, which included fruits and grains.

YEAR: 1843

EVENT: The British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food is formed.

YEAR: 1843

EVENT: (Amos) Bronson Alcott (1799–1888), a relative and neighbor of William Alcott, and his family (including daughter Louisa May Alcott, the future author of Little Women) and followers found America’s first vegetarian commune in Harvard, Massachusetts. The farm is named “Fruitlands.”

YEAR: 1847

EVENT: The first Vegetarian Society is formed on a September evening at a coastal hospital in England. Within a year, it grows from 150 to 265 members, ranging in age from fourteen to seventy-six. Before the end of the century, vegetarian societies form in many other countries, including the U.S. (1850), Germany (1867), Austria (1878), France (1879), Switzerland (1880), New Zealand (1882), Hungary (1884), Australia (1886), India (1889), Ireland (1890), Chile (1891), Netherlands (1894), Sweden (1895), Denmark (1896), Belgium (1897), and Italy (1899).

YEAR: 1850

EVENT: During a time when most people believe illness to be a mystery or the will of God, on May 15 at Clinton Hall in New York City, the Presbyterian minister turned health reformer Sylvester Graham (1794–1851) co-founds the American Vegetarian Society with Rev. William Metcalfe (1788–1862) and Dr. William Alcott (1798–1859, who serves as its first president), with significant support from the Bible Christian Church (BCC).



YEAR: 1853

EVENT: At a banquet held by the American Vegetarian Society, vegetarian suffragist Susan B. Anthony (1820–1906) raises a toast to both vegetarianism and women’s rights.

YEAR: 1854

EVENT: Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862)’s Walden, an account of his experiment in living in solitude on Walden Pond in Massachusetts, is published.



“I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals.”

—HENRY DAVID THOREAU



YEAR: 1860

EVENT: John Smith, of Yorkshire, England, writes The Principles and Practices of Vegetarian Cookery, which includes a substantial amount of theory (“being an attempt to prove from history, anatomy, physiology, and chemistry, that the original, natural, and best diet of man is derived from the vegetable kingdom”) as well as several hundred recipes.

YEAR: 1863

EVENT: Ellen G. White (1827–1915), husband James White, and others found what is now known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Battle Creek, Michigan. In June, she reports visions from God inspiring her to promote a meatless diet. Three years later, the couple founds the Western Health Reform Institute, which later achieves world renown as the Battle Creek Sanitarium under the leadership of John Harvey Kellogg.



YEAR: 1868

EVENT: Influenced by Sylvester Graham, James Caleb Jackson (1811–1895)’s How to Treat the Sick Without Medicine is published, promoting a fruit- and grain-based diet, such as the one served at Our Home on the Hillside, a Dansville, New York–based sanitarium where he invents the first cold grain-based breakfast cereal, which he dubs “Granula” (Latin for “little grains”), and which serves as an inspiration for the Whites’ Battle Creek institute.

YEAR: 1881

EVENT: Anna Kingsford (1846–1888), one of the first English women to earn a medical degree, writes about the benefits of vegetarianism in The Perfect Way in Diet and helps found the Food Reform Society. She travels throughout Europe to speak out about vegetarianism and against animal experimentation (which she notably managed to avoid in medical school).

YEAR: 1883

EVENT: The first book of vegetarian history, The Ethics of Diet, is written by Howard Williams (1837–1931). It will influence vegetarians from Leo Tolstoy to Henry Salt to Mohandas Gandhi.

“The use of animal food… is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to moral feeling—killing.”

—LEO TOLSTOY



YEAR: 1888

EVENT: The London Vegetarian Society is formed, with its own publication, The Vegetarian.

YEAR: Late 1800s

EVENT: A Seventh-day Adventist for much of his life, John Harvey Kellogg (1852–1943) works during his youth as an errand runner for Ellen and James White, after which they sponsor his medical education at an Adventist-run school in New Jersey. Upon graduation, he is hired by—and later heads—the Battle Creek Sanitarium (originally the Western Health Reform Institute). During a time when a typical breakfast might feature sausage and whiskey, the noted surgeon develops for the sanitarium dozens of innovative meatless foods—most notably flaked and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, which will revolutionize the morning meal within a decade. The sanitarium attracts leading celebrities of the day, including Amelia Earhart, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Mary Todd Lincoln, John D. Rockefeller, President Taft, Sojourner Truth, and Johnny Weissmuller. Kellogg becomes the leading promoter of vegetarianism in his time, and the success of the W. K. Kellogg Company (run by his brother Will Keith) inspires the founding of other national companies providing ready-to-eat cereals that often replace breakfast meats.

“There is nothing necessary or desirable for human nutrition to be found in meats or flesh foods, which are not found in and derived from vegetable products.”

YEAR: 1890

EVENT: After a St. Louis doctor suggests grinding peanuts as a source of protein for elderly patients unable to chew meat, George Bayle begins to sell peanut butter commercially. Five years later, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg registers the first patent for a peanut-based “Process of Preparing Nut Meal,” which is served at the Battle Creek Sanitarium as a healthful meat substitute. By 1899, the U.S. is producing an estimated two million pounds. After being featured at the 1904 St. Louis World Fair, sales of peanut butter skyrocket to approximately 34 million pounds by 1907.



YEAR: 1892

EVENT: Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) writes his influential vegetarian essay “The First Step” as the preface to the Russian translation of The Ethics of Diet.

YEAR: 1893

YEAR: 1895

EVENT: New York’s first vegetarian restaurant—the aptly named Vegetarian Restaurant Number 1—is opened by the New York Vegetarian Society in the Hotel Byron on West 23rd Street. (By comparison, in 1897 there are thirteen vegetarian restaurants in London.) Within five years, a chain of vegetarian cafes called Pure Food will also serve meatless meals in Manhattan. Within thirty-five years, a chain of three vegetarian restaurants called Farmfood will serve meatless meals on the west side of Manhattan.

YEAR: 1898

EVENT: The Vegetarians’ Home and Teetotaller Café, later renamed Hiltl, opens in Zurich. Said to be the world’s oldest continuously-operating vegetarian restaurant, it still operates today, and the owners have added a chain of vegetarian fast food spots called Tibits by Hiltl.

YEAR: 1899

EVENT: Influenced by poet Percy Shelley’s poems and pamphlets, animal welfare activist Henry Salt (1851–1939) writes his classic book The Logic of Vegetarianism, which later influences Mohandas Gandhi to renew his commitment to vegetarianism. He also introduces Gandhi to the writings of Thoreau, including Civil Disobedience, which Gandhi cites as a major influence. Salt is considered the first writer to champion animals’ rights, via his 1894 Animals’ Rights, versus mere animal welfare reform.

YEAR: 1900

EVENT: Chicago’s first vegetarian restaurant, Pure Food Lunch Room, opens at 176 E. Madison in the Loop.

YEAR: 1900

EVENT: Noted scientist and inventor (a rival of Thomas Edison, he has been called “inventor of the electrical age”) Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) writes an article titled “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy” for the June issue of Century Illustrated, in which he calls “want of healthful nutriment” the “chief evil,” condemns the inefficiency of raising animals as food, and praises vegetarianism. Over his adult life, he shifts away from meat toward fish and then finally to a vegetarian diet.

“It is certainly preferable to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, that vegetarianism is a commendable departure from the established barbarous habit. That we can subsist on plant food and perform our work even to advantage is not a theory, but a well-demonstrated fact. Many races living almost exclusively on vegetables are of superior physique and strength. There is no doubt that some plant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it in regard to both mechanical and mental performance.… In view of these facts every effort should be made to stop the wanton and cruel slaughter of animals, which must be destructive to our morals. To free ourselves from animal instincts and appetites, which keep us down, we should begin at the very root from which we spring: we should effect a radical reform in the character of the food.”

—NIKOLA TESLA, “THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING HUMAN ENERGY”





YEAR: 1901

EVENT: The first Vegetarian Society is formed in Russia. After the 1917 revolution, vegetarianism will be declared illegal in Soviet Russia, leading to the closing of its vegetarian societies and restaurants.

YEAR: 1902

EVENT: Pulp publishing magnate Bernarr Macfadden (1868–1955) opens his first Physical Culture vegetarian restaurant in lower Manhattan. Within six years, it is a successful chain with locations in Boston, Buffalo, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. He also writes more than one hundred books, espousing a diet made up mostly of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains as vital to good health—a revolutionary concept at the time.

YEAR: 1906

EVENT: After a spate of stockyard scandals, the novel The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair (1878–1968), is published, revealing the revoltingly unsanitary conditions and inhumane labor practices at Chicago stockyards. It becomes an instant bestseller, and fuels both the growing vegetarian movement and the addition of meatless entrees (from omelets to pastas) on mainstream restaurant menus.

YEAR: 1907

EVENT: On September 24, a New York Times article titled “Cancer Increasing Among Meat Eaters… on the Other Hand, Italians and Chinese, Practically Vegetarians, Show the Lowest Mortality of All” reports on Chicago-based Dr. G. Cooke Adams’ seven-year study indicating higher cancer risk among those who eat meat, stating, “Dr. Adams has proved conclusively that diet is a most important factor in the increase in the disease and its death rate.”

“There cannot be the slightest question that the great increase in cancer among the foreign-born over the prevalence of that disease in their native countries is due to the increased consumption of animal foods, particularly those derived from diseased animals.”

—DR. G. COOKE ADAMS, IN THE NEW YORK TIMES (SEPTEMBER 24, 1907)



YEAR: 1908

EVENT: The International Vegetarian Union is formed to unite vegetarian societies around the world and to organize a global conference in a different part of the world every two or three years.

EVENT: The June issue of the Vegetarian Society of Great Britain’s magazine Vegetarian Messenger reports that during a recent bout of mastoiditis, American inventor Thomas Edison (1847–1931) “ceased using meat and went for a thorough course of vegetarianism. Mr. Edison was so pleased with the change of diet that, now he has regained his normal health, he continues to renounce meat in all its forms.”

“The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.”

—THOMAS EDISON, “EDISON HAILS ERA OF SPEED,” FORT WAYNE SENTINEL (DECEMBER 31, 1902)



YEAR: 1917

EVENT: The United States enters World War I in April, leading head of the U.S. Food Administration Herbert Hoover to launch “Meatless Mondays” and “Wheatless Wednesdays” to inspire Americans to reduce their consumption of these staple foods to help increase exports to starving allies in Europe. More than 13 million American families—the majority—pledge their participation over the course of U.S. involvement (ending in November 1918). Millions also plant liberty and war gardens, which will later be called victory gardens.

YEAR: 1920s

EVENT: Soy food products, such as soy bread, cereal, cheese, coffee, ice cream, milk, and nuts, are developed and promoted to a wider audience by Seventh-day Adventists such as T. A. Van Gundy (1874–1935) and Jethro Kloss (1863–1923).

YEAR: 1925

EVENT: Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950), a vegetarian who in 1901 famously quipped, “I was a cannibal for twenty-five years. For the rest I have been a vegetarian,” is awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.

“It is nearly fifty years since I was assured by a conclave of doctors that if I did not eat meat I should die of starvation.”

—GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, THE QUINTESSENCE OF G.B.S.



YEAR: 1929

EVENT: A Saturday Evening Post article reports that as a result of “Meatless Monday” and other World War I dietary changes, “Americans began to look seriously into the question of what and how much they were eating. Lots of people discovered for the first time that they could eat less and feel no worse—frequently much better.”

YEAR: 1929

EVENT: The stock market crash of October 29 sets off the Great Depression, a time when farmers are producing lots of food that few can afford to purchase—so Americans go hungry, and farmers start going out of business. This leads to the first Farm Bill, passed in 1933 as part of FDR’s New Deal, and the updated Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, which stipulates that the Farm Bill be updated every five years, as it is to this day.



YEAR: 1930s

EVENT: Sadie Schildkraut (1899–1981), known as the “mother of cooked vegetarian dishes,” runs a chain of fifteen vegetarian restaurants throughout New York City. Yidisher Vegetarian Society of New York members, who view vegetarianism as a moral philosophy, dine on signature dishes such as mushroom cutlets, protose steak, and creamed beets.

YEAR: 1931

EVENT: Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) helps to launch the vegan movement in London on November 20. He credits the writings of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau with greatly influencing his philosophy of nonviolence. While other Indian students renounce their vegetarianism in carnivorous England, he is influenced by Henry Salt’s A Plea for Vegetarianism to re-commit to it. After joining the London Vegetarian Society, he is elected to its executive committee and contributes articles to its newspaper.

“I do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.”

YEAR: 1932–1934

EVENT: In the U.K., the People’s League of Health and the Gowland Hopkins Committee report major problems with the safety of dairy, with a minimum of 40 percent of tested dairy cows being infected with tuberculosis and chronically transmitting it to a huge portion of the country’s human population. (In 1930, 58 percent of a sample of London children test positive for tuberculosis exposure.)

YEAR: 1934

EVENT: Automaker Henry Ford (1863–1947), a vegetarian who believes in reincarnation and is a soybean fanatic, showcases soybean dishes (such as cookies and puree) at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago.

YEAR: 1939

EVENT: Jethro Kloss’s book on herbal medicine, natural foods, and home remedies, titled Back to Eden, is published and goes on to sell more than four million copies and to help inspire the natural foods movement of the 1960s and 1970s.

YEAR: 1941

EVENT: The United States enters World War II. Americans are encouraged to plant “victory gardens”—in back yards, front yards, vacant lots, and even public land, from the Boston Commons to San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park (which at one point has eight hundred gardens)—to grow their own food. In 1943, U.S. rations limit families to twenty-eight ounces of meat per week. Over the course of the war, more than 20 million such gardens cumulatively produce more than 40 percent of the fresh vegetables consumed in the U.S.



YEAR: 1942

EVENT: B&H Dairy kosher vegetarian restaurant (mostly meatless, though lox is served) is opened by Abie Bergson and his partner Heller at 127 Second Avenue in New York City. Today, B&H still serves its housemade soups, pierogi, and specialties like vegetarian cutlet with kasha and mushroom gravy, along with a “vegetarian liver” made from eggs, onions, soybeans, and a not-so-secret ingredient: “love.”



YEAR: 1944

EVENT: The term “vegan” is coined by Donald Watson (1910–2005), a woodworker in Britain, to describe vegetarians who do not consume dairy or eggs. He even specifies in his Vegan Society newsletter how it should be pronounced: “Veegan, not Veejan.”

YEAR: 1945

EVENT: The New York Times Magazine runs the story “Heyday for the Vegetarians” on vegetarians’ efforts to convert meat eaters in the wake of meat shortages. Symon Gould, an editor of American Vegetarian magazine, classifies the hierarchy of vegetarians.

“First, and noblest, is the ethical vegetarian, who refuses to eat meat on moral or philosophical grounds.… Second is the religious vegetarian [who] does not eat meat because of the dictates of his religion.… Third is the esthetic vegetarian, who would rather avoid… the grey, parboiled flesh of a dead animal.… Fourth is the scientific vegetarian, who has compared the anatomies of the animal world and has decided that man is by nature a herbivorous animal and not meant to eat meat at all.… And fifth… are the dietetic vegetarians, who eat no meat only because it’s healthier not to.”

—SYMON GOULD, QUOTED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE (1945)





YEAR: Post-WWII

EVENT: The United States, which had built ten large-scale munitions factories by the end of the war, sees their production shift from bombs to fertilizers. Agribusiness is born as large-scale farming becomes a chemical-based process.

YEAR: 1948

EVENT: Dr. Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz found a Vegan Society in California, which continues to 1960.

YEAR: 1948

EVENT: The Framingham Heart Study is established in Massachusetts to identify the factors contributing to cardiovascular disease. The half-century-plus study spurs the publication of 1,200 articles in leading medical journals on key risk factors such as obesity, smoking, high fat diet, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

“If Americans adopted a vegetarian diet, the [heart disease epidemic responsible for the death of half of all Americans] would disappear.”

—DR. WILLIAM CASTELLI, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY, ON THE PBS/SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FRONTIERS EPISODE “AFFAIRS OF THE HEART”



YEAR: 1949

EVENT: The First American Vegetarian Convention is held in August at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

YEAR: Mid–1900s

EVENT: The advent of nutritional science leads vegetarianism to be embraced as a healthful dietary option.

YEAR: 1958

EVENT: After spending his young adult years growing his hair long and living off the land in California as one of about a dozen “Nature Boys,” Robert Bootzin (1914–2004)—later known as Gypsy Boots—opens the first health-food restaurant in Los Angeles, known as the Back to Nature Health Hut, which attracts a celebrity clientele including Pat Boone, Red Buttons, Angie Dickinson, George Hamilton, and Gloria Swanson. Through more than twenty appearances on Steve Allen’s popular talk show and several books, he introduces a wide American audience to the idea of a healthful vegetarian diet and edibles such as figs, garlic, wheatgrass, and “smoothies.”



YEAR: 1960

EVENT: H. Jay Dinshah (1933–2000) establishes the American Vegan Society in New Jersey. His wife, Freya Dinshah, will write The Vegan Kitchen, the first American book to use the word “vegan,” in 1965, and will run the AVS after his death.

YEAR: 1961

EVENT: An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) asserts that “a vegetarian diet can prevent 90 percent of our thrombo-embolic disease and 97 percent of our coronary occlusions.” The statement is widely reported by vegetarian publications in subsequent years.

YEAR: 1962

EVENT: Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring is published, helping to spur the global environmental movement, including the focus on organic methods of production, and encouraging some to move toward vegetarianism.

“In the diet in the average home, meats and any products derived from animal fats contain the heaviest residues of chlorinated hydrocarbons [i.e., pesticides]. This is because these chemicals are soluble in fat. Cooking does not destroy residues.”

—RACHEL CARSON, IN SILENT SPRING (1962)



YEAR: 1967

EVENT: The Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the first Zen training monastery outside of Asia, is established in the San Francisco Bay area, with Edward Espé Brown becoming the head cook. Three years later, he writes The Tassajara Bread Book, which features Buddhist vegetarian recipes and goes on to sell a million copies. In 1971, Brown is ordained as a Zen priest. In 1973, he comes out with his second cookbook, Tassajara Cooking. He will later be the subject of Doris Dörrie’s 2007 documentary How to Cook Your Life.

YEAR: 1968

EVENT: Manhattan socialite and radio host Pegeen Fitzgerald sees her book Meatless Cooking: Pegeen’s Vegetarian Recipes published, and it proves popular with the two million listeners of the radio show that she and her husband co-host. Her 1989 New York Times obituary says she headed two animal welfare organizations and “believed deeply in antivivisection and ethical vegetarianism, refusing to eat meat or fish or to wear a fur coat ‘because I don’t want any living thing killed for my own use or pleasure.’”

YEAR: 1968

EVENT: Ten Talents, by nutritionist Rosalie Hurd and her physician husband Frank Hurd, is published, becoming one of the first few vegetarian/vegan resources available. (The 2012 edition of the Genesis 1:29–inspired cookbook is its forty-ninth printing.)

YEAR: 1968

EVENT: The Beatles study transcendental meditation in India. Afterward, George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr declare their vegetarianism, inspiring others around the globe to follow suit. All but Lennon will remain lifelong vegetarians.

YEAR: 1969

EVENT: On April 1, Silver Star–decorated Marine and World War II veteran Jim Baker (also known as “Father Yod”) opens The Source on Sunset Boulevard, one of the first hugely popular vegetarian restaurants in Los Angeles. It features a menu of items (such as lentil-based veggie burgers) said to be “consciously prepared for the highest vibration” and attracts a celebrity clientele said to include Warren Beatty, Marlon Brando, Julie Christie, Jane Fonda, Goldie Hawn, Don Johnson, John Lennon, Steve McQueen, Carl Reiner, and Donald Sutherland. (In the 1977 film Annie Hall, Woody Allen’s character Alvy Singer visits The Source, ordering “alfalfa sprouts and mashed yeast.”) The restaurant will become the subject of the 2007 book The Source: The Untold Story of Father Yod, Ya Ho Wa 13, and the Source Family by Isis Aquarian with Electricity Aquarian, upon which Jodi Wille and Maria Demopoulos’s 2013 documentary The Source Family is based.



YEAR: 1970

EVENT: The first Earth Day is held on April 22, a bipartisan effort in support of a healthy, sustainable planet, marking the birth of the modern mainstream environmental movement.

YEAR: 1970

EVENT: Frances Moore Lappé writes a seventy-five-page pamphlet making the case for a vegetarian diet. An expanded version is published the following year as the revolutionary book Diet for a Small Planet and goes on to sell more than three million copies. Arguing that “hunger is human made,” Lappé’s economic and environmental rationales against meat—such as that a cow had to be fed sixteen pounds of grain and soy to produce one pound of beef—merged with concerns about global hunger to spur vegetarians and activists to take up the cause in earnest.

YEAR: 1970

EVENT: A year after actor Johnny Weissmuller opens his American Natural Foods store in Los Angeles, Bob Goldberg and three friends (Paul Lewin, still a partner in 2013, and Michael Besancon and Spencer Windbiel, who will move on in 1985) take over its operations, which include a seven-seat juice and sandwich bar. They buy the store and transform the bar into a full-fledged vegetarian cafe, renaming it Follow Your Heart. After they discover their supplier of supposedly eggless mayonnaise to be fraudulent, they end up having to create their own—and the vegan mayonnaise Vegenaise is born. A popular national line of vegetarian salad dressings and Vegan Gourmet cheeses follows.

“Follow Your Heart was a very different scene from The Source [another LA vegetarian restaurant of the day], which was run by a cult led by a real character. We were the opposite of that, preferring to think of everyone as a brother or sister, whether they wore a suit and tie or had long hair or no hair. Even stronger than our belief in vegetarianism was the belief that everyone should be welcomed like they would be when visiting a friend’s home. We’ve never aimed to proselytize or get people to change. Number one, you can’t—and number two, it’s morally wrong, because it disrespects others’ right to choose. We’ve always aimed to serve food that people would enjoy and simply said, ‘Taste this—it’s delicious!’ In 1972, you could get a Love Plate—an avocado sandwich and a cup of soup—for 95 cents. It’s still on the menu today—at $9.50.… Only about 20 to 25 percent of those dining at Follow Your Heart are vegetarian—which is not surprising if you think about what percentage of diners at any Chinese restaurant are Chinese.… When my generation embraced vegetarianism, it was considered radical. But it’s an interesting dynamic that many of today’s Millennials skip vegetarianism altogether and go right to veganism.… The ease with which you can find something to eat almost anywhere today is simply stunning. I know I live in Mecca, but it’s just not difficult to be a vegetarian anymore. What excites me most is not only the dawning of wonderful meatless creativity [as exemplified by restaurants such as Dave Anderson’s Madeleine Bistro and Tal Ronnen’s Crossroads], but also the dawning of the recognition of the relationship between diet and health.”

—BOB GOLDBERG, CO-OWNER, FOLLOW YOUR HEART (CANOGA PARK, CALIFORNIA)





YEAR: 1971

EVENT: Alice Waters founds Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, where she launches a revolution by rejecting flavorless commercial produce and starting to create her own network of local farmers and other suppliers. While not vegetarian in mission, she is credited as the creator of an alternative food supply that inspires the improvement of the quality, purity, and flavor of vegetables served in the United States, which encourages more chefs to cook with them and more diners to order them.

“During my years at Chez Panisse, Alice Waters had vegetable dishes that tasted so good, but they never had to shout that they were ‘vegetarian’ dishes. You’d see a dish of pizza with nettles and an egg on the menu, and you wouldn’t be thinking, ‘Oh, that’s vegetarian’—you’d be thinking, ‘Oh, that sounds delicious!’ Zuni Café was like that, too. I think that approach was really important.”

—DEBORAH MADISON, FOUNDING CHEF OF GREENS RESTAURANT



YEAR: 1971–1976

EVENT: During Earl Butz’s tenure as Secretary of Agriculture, he implements many broad-based changes to U.S. agricultural policy. Small farmers are told to “get big, or get out,” and many family-run farms go under. Subsidies are instead given to big agriculture, which—aided by new chemical-based fertilizers and technology—has larger-than-ever harvests and produces an unprecedented supply of food. While Americans’ food costs as a percentage of their income fall over the next three decades, healthcare costs rise in similar proportion.

“When I wrote Diet for a Small Planet in 1971, I could never have imagined that four decades on, we’d still face massive hunger, despite enough food for all and 40 percent more produced per person than when I wrote that book!… Since SOFI 12’s [State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012’s] release last fall, the FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] has continued to develop its measures and updated its online Food Security Indicators. It now encourages us to see hunger as a range, from the chronic and severely undernourished 868 million to a larger number the FAO calls ‘food inadequate,’ which climbs as high as 1.3 billion people [out of a total global population estimated at 6.974 billion].”

YEAR: 1972

EVENT: The feminist collective (and mostly if not entirely vegetarian) restaurant Mother Courage is opened by Dolores Alexander and Jill Ward in New York City’s Greenwich Village.

“I remember reading Anna Thomas’s Vegetarian Epicure, and being very taken with how well-traveled she was and how well she conveyed the sensuality of food. It balanced the compelling politics of Frankie [Frances Moore Lappé]’s Diet for a Small Planet.”

—AUTHOR MOLLIE KATZEN



“We visited Mother Courage restaurant many, many times in the 1970s. When we asked them for help with our plans to open Bloodroot, they opened their books and were enormously helpful to us.”

YEAR: 1973

EVENT: The Moosewood Collective—a restaurant co-founded by Mollie Katzen and others—opens in January in Ithaca, New York, and specializes in healthful natural foods cuisine. It commits to a vegetarian menu the following year. Through its continuous operation for more than four decades and the publication of a dozen cookbooks, it becomes a driving force in creative vegetarian cuisine and is eventually named by Bon Appétit as “one of the 13 most influential restaurants of the 20th century.” In 1977, The Moosewood Cookbook by Mollie Katzen is published, and it goes on to be cited by The New York Times as one of the ten bestselling cookbooks of all time, with more than two million copies sold. Multiple editions of Katzen’s book The Enchanted Broccoli Forest will cumulatively sell more than a million copies.

YEAR: 1973

EVENT: Deborah Santana (wife of musician Carlos Santana) and her sister Kitsaun open Dipti Nivas, one of the first vegetarian restaurants in San Francisco. Over the coming decade, it becomes renowned for its casseroles and veggie burgers at reasonable prices.

“One of the biggest influences on my cuisine was my obsession with international ethnic folk music. I’d visit music festivals as a hobby, as it offered a full cultural immersion in not only the folk music but the food of places like Greece, Turkey, the Balkans, and Israel. It’s how I first discovered tabbouleh, and how things like hummus became mainstream.… I had earned $2.25 an hour cooking at a vegetarian restaurant called the Shandygaff in San Francisco, so my brother and some friends recruited me to come back to Ithaca to help them put a restaurant together, and I ended up staying. When I wrote The Moosewood Cookbook, it was a homespun effort in every way. The original project was collated by hand; it was written in a very private voice for my siblings and cousins and something that I never imagined would become so very public.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, CO-FOUNDER, THE MOOSEWOOD COLLECTIVE



“Aside from Tofu Cookery (1983), my very first cookbooks were all Mollie Katzen cookbooks, like Moosewood and Enchanted Broccoli Forest. Those were the books that got me started.”

YEAR: 1974

EVENT: The first issue of Vegetarian Times magazine is published by its founder and editor—twenty-three-year-old Chicago nurse Paul Barrett Obis, Jr.—who distributes it through health-food stores. By 1987, its paid circulation will grow to 133,000, and by its four-hundredth issue in January 2013, it will hit 315,000.

“The more I embodied vegetarianism, the more I realized that it was not merely diet. It became a spiritual/ethical/compassionate/political/health issue. In short, it became my lifestyle. I could no longer separate my vegetarianism from other aspects of my life.”

—ELLEN SUE SPIVACK, WRITING IN THE OCTOBER 1975 ISSUE OF VEGETARIAN TIMES

“If I have to pick the book that had the most impact on me, I would say Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation, since I instantly became a vegetarian after reading it.”

—JANE GOODALL, WRITING IN NEW SCIENTIST (APRIL 16, 2008)



YEAR: 1976

EVENT: Cornell Class of 1971 graduate Julie Jordan comes out with her first cookbook Wings of Life: Vegetarian Cookery (later to be followed by 1986’s Cabbagetown Café Cookbook, and 1998’s A Taste of Julie Jordan). From 1977 through 1991, she owns vegetarian Cabbagetown Café in Ithaca, New York, which is known for its cashew chili, enchilada del dia, and fresh-baked bread. After the café closes in 1993, its signature salad of greens, chickpeas, broccoli, brown rice, herbed tofu, olives, nuts, and cheeses lives on at Wegmans, where Jordan today oversees the development of the Northeast supermarket chain’s meatless prepared dishes.

“Julie Jordan’s Wings of Life cookbook was our bible at the very beginning.… It was unsophisticated, but honest, and the recipes were for simple food with integrity and flavor.”

The “McGovern report” causes an uproar in the meat, egg, and dairy industries.

“[Senator George] McGovern later told me that he took more pride in this work than in anything he had ever done, even if it had cost him and some of his colleagues in the Midwestern states their political careers. This was one of my first deeply troubling experiences with the politics of science.”

EVENT: The Natural Gourmet Institute (NGI) is founded in New York City by Dr. Annemarie Colbin on the principle that “what we eat significantly affects our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.” While not vegetarian in mission, the institute hosts popular weekly Friday night vegetarian dinners showcasing its students’ cooking and produces many influential vegetarian chefs, including Amanda Cohen of Dirt Candy, Tal Ronnen of Crossroads, and vegan cookbook author Bryant Terry.



YEAR: 1977

EVENT: With a huge peach surplus, California legislation prohibiting farmers from selling their produce outside commercial markets leaves tons of peaches to rot. Angry farmers dump them on the lawn of the State Capitol, leading Governor Jerry Brown to finally relax restrictions and allow farmers to sell produce at farmers’ markets, which spurs their proliferation. By 1979, the farmers’ market in Gardena becomes the first to open in southern California, and one of the first few in the state. By 2005, there will be nearly five hundred farmers’ markets in California, and by 2009, five thousand farmers’ markets in the United States. As of 2013, there are 8,144, according to the USDA.



“I moved to New Mexico [in the 1990s] to open a restaurant, but there were some delays, so when one day I overheard someone say he needed help at the Santa Fe Farmers Market, I said, ‘I have some time.’ The next week, I was manager of the market. And it was the best thing I ever did—I met the most wonderful growers.… It’s not easy to grow fruit in this climate—some years we have it, many years we don’t—so it was mostly vegetables. Santa Fe has always been known for its chiles, but there’s much more than chiles in the market. Today, we have heirloom corn that is ground for the most wonderful cornmeal, and by late July we have everything.”

A Conversation with Deborah Madison, Founding Chef of Greens Restaurant (1979–1983)


“I’ve never identified myself as vegetarian. When I was a student at the San Francisco Zen Center, we decided as a group that out of respect for the Buddhist principle of not taking life, we would be vegetarian within our community, so that was the way we ate. I took over the cooking for the Center from a good macrobiotic cook, but as we had visitors at our tables, we didn’t want them to have to wonder what they were being served. The goal, for me, was to create food that would be familiar and bring people together at the table. My influences were very classic—Escoffier, Larousse Gastronomique—so it was kind of the reverse of what others are doing today: Instead of whole wheat pancakes, people wanted pancakes that would fluff up, so I switched to white flour. I added butter and cheese to the menu—as this was well before the vegan era.

“When Greens first opened, it was only open for lunch, and we had women [guests] who would say, ‘I’m going to bring my husband!’ And he’d get there at the end of a long day or week and want a steak. But we won husbands over with touches like bringing warm focaccia with rosemary to the table. We also set out roasted almonds wrapped in parchment paper, and it was like unwrapping a present! I got that idea from Elizabeth David’s Salt, Spices and Aromatics in the English Kitchen. And we’d win them over with dishes like Many Layered Crepe Cake, which had layers of fresh tomato sauce or cheese between each crepe—it created a lot of physical drama at the table and gave focus that replaced the lack of meat.

“Greens in 1979 was a very stylish restaurant. I didn’t want it to have any vegetarian clichés, so we didn’t serve sprouts and there were no macramé hangings on the walls. In the early days, the food was pretty cheese-y. Of our early customers, there was only one who didn’t eat dairy, which was so rare that he had his own nickname: Non-Dairy Jerry. Today, that part has really flipped.

“Today—finally—nobody has to make a big deal out of being vegetarian. And I have seen that many people are eating far less meat, and the meat they are eating is of higher quality. I do make it a point to tell people that I am not a vegetarian because I don’t want people to not invite me over. But I do eat vegetarian a lot of the time, and when I’m out on book tour, I frequently order vegetarian dishes, especially if I’m not eating somewhere I trust the other ingredients.”



YEAR: 1978

EVENT: When The Inn at Little Washington opens in Washington, Virginia—70 miles outside Washington, DC—few suppliers are willing to make deliveries. Chef-owner Patrick O’Connell sources produce from dozens of local farmers instead, and by January 2011 the restaurant’s success will allow him to hire the Inn’s own farmer-in-residence to grow specialty produce ranging from haricots verts to microgreens to sweet peas on the Inn’s property to supplement that provided by more than 100 different suppliers, which are spotlighted on the Inn’s vegetarian tasting menu, arguably America’s finest.

The results are summarized for the U.S. Congress.

YEAR: 1981

EVENT: Studies published in the journals Cancer and Lancet show that lung cancer among 14,000 smokers is substantially lower among those consuming beta-carotene-containing vegetables. These studies suggest that increased consumption of plant-based foods may reduce cancer risk.

“Whereas earlier thinking [e.g., Doll and Peto’s 1981 landmark report] about nutrition and cancer emphasized the adverse effects of fat and other components in the diet, the most compelling evidence of the last decade has indicated the importance of protective factors, largely unidentified, in fruits and vegetables.”

“If, through some miracle, I decided to resort to a vegetable diet forever, this new book by Madhur Jaffrey, who is to my mind the finest authority on Indian cooking in America, would be my Bible. It is by far the most comprehensive, fascinating, and inspired book on vegetable cookery that I have encountered.”

YEAR: 1982

EVENT: The New York Times publishes Marian Burros’s article “In Defense of Vegetarianism: Seven Yeas,” based on conversations with seven well-known vegetarians, including actors Marty Feldman, Carol Kane, and Dennis Weaver. She writes, “Being a vegetarian in a largely carnivorous society has often meant second-class gastronomic citizenship.… But the situation has improved significantly in the last few years, say a number of well-known people who attempt to follow one version or another of a vegetarian diet. The improvement results, in part at least, from the increase in the number of people who call themselves vegetarians. There are now too many of them to be ignored. The Vegetarian Information Service, a nonprofit educational organization, puts the figure in this country at between seven and 12 million.”

YEAR: 1983

EVENT: Nikki and David Goldbeck’s American Wholefoods Cuisine: 1,300 Meatless Wholesome Recipes, from Short Order to Gourmet is published, leading Newsday to characterize it as “the vegetarian Joy of Cooking” and Vegetarian Times as “a monumental work.” It will be reissued in 2005.

YEAR: 1983

EVENT: In her New York Times article “New Research on the Vegetarian Diet,” Jane Brody argues that “the main question has become whether it is healthier to be a vegetarian than to be a meat eater,” which her column answers in the affirmative.

“On the whole, vegetarians are less likely to be afflicted with the chronic diseases that are leading killers and cripplers in societies where meat is the centerpiece of the diet.… To glean the heart-saving benefits of vegetarianism, consumption of such foods as hard cheese, cream cheese, ice cream, and eggs should be moderate.”

—JANE BRODY, THE NEW YORK TIMES (OCTOBER 12, 1983)



YEAR: 1983

EVENT: The March issue of Vegetarian Times contains an interview with Nobel Prize–winning author and vegetarian Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904–1991), who is quoted as saying, “Vegetarianism for me is a protest… protesting against everything which is not just: about the fact that there is so much sickness, so much death, so much cruelty. My vegetarianism is my religion, and it’s part of my protest against the conduct of the world.”

YEAR: 1983

EVENT: Customer requests for the hearty soup recipes served at the popular Los Angeles vegetarian restaurant lead to the publication of Follow Your Heart’s Vegetarian Soup Cookbook by Janice Cook Migliaccio. Co-owner Bob Goldberg recalls, “We serve three to five soups every day, including one dairy soup and one no-salt/no-oil soup, and have historically given out samples of each so customers could decide which to order. People loved them so much that they’d ask for the recipes, so it was a no-brainer to decide to do a cookbook. Of course, those recipes feature more butter and dairy than we use today.”

YEAR: 1983

EVENT: Physician John A. McDougall writes The McDougall Plan, which embraces a starch-based diet (e.g., beans, bread, corn, lentils, pasta, potatoes, rice) incorporating vegetables and fruits and eschewing animal-based foods and added oils. It is the first book by a Western doctor suggesting that food combining to make “complete proteins” is unnecessary, debunking a myth that is still widespread. He goes on to write another dozen health-related books, which collectively sell more than a million copies.

“All large populations of trim, healthy people, throughout verifiable human history, have obtained the bulk of their calories from starch. Examples of once thriving people include Japanese, Chinese, and other Asians eating sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and/or rice; Incas in South America eating potatoes; Mayans and Aztecs in Central America eating corn; and Egyptians in the Middle East eating wheat.”

EVENT: Soy foods pioneer Louise Hagler’s book Tofu Cookery is published.



“Louise Hagler’s 1983 book Tofu Cookery is one of the books that changed my life. After my mom brought it home, she and my sister and I—who all went vegetarian together—started cooking and eating from it, almost every day it seemed. As we’d never shopped or cooked together before, it was the cookbook that brought everyone together. For the time, it had cutting-edge food photography, and everything looked great. I still make the brownies and the barbecue tofu—I even make the tofu balls, which are flavored with peanut butter and soy sauce, every week.”

She later reveals that she was told on her first day not to recommend eating less meat or less of any other food category.

“In the industry-friendly climate of the Reagan administration [1981–1989], the producers of foods that might be affected by such advice would complain to their beneficiaries in Congress, and the report would never be published. This scenario was no paranoid fantasy; federal health officials had endured a decade of almost constant congressional interference with their dietary recommendations.”

“Edward [Espé Brown] had written the Tassajara Bread Book, and [when I wanted to write my first book] the New York publishing community asked ‘Who’s Deborah Madison?’ I couldn’t get a book deal unless Edward’s name was on it, too. So we co-authored The Greens Cookbook.… I caught up with him a few years back during a visit to Larkspur. He made biscuits, and I was so impressed to see his hands and how they worked the dough, and how very delicious the biscuits were.”

He writes several national bestsellers, including 1990’s Dr. Dean Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease; 1993’s Eat More, Weigh Less; and 2007’s The Spectrum.

“Life-Style Shift Can Unclog Ailing Arteries, Study Finds… [Dr. Dean Ornish’s] study showed that a vegetarian diet, moderate exercise, and an hour a day of yoga and meditation could produce a reversal of atherosclerosis, a blockage of the arteries that can lead to a heart attack, in men and women who were strict in following the daily regimen. Experts say this is the first study to show that such blockage can be reversed without using cholesterol-lowering drugs or surgery.”

The result is The Chef’s Garden, which today supplies some of the best chefs in America with specialty produce such as microgreens, micro herbs, heirloom vegetables, specialty lettuces, and edible flowers. Their nonprofit Veggie U supplies classroom garden kits and a five-week science program that has been taught in 4,700 elementary and special needs classes across thirty-two states and Washington, DC.

“The quality of the produce that The Chef’s Garden delivers is absolutely unbelievable. They’re always turning us on to something special.… Farmer Lee Jones has been predicting that vegetables would become ‘the next center of the plate item’ for years.”

“Early findings from the most comprehensive large study ever undertaken of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease are challenging much of American dietary dogma. The study, being conducted in China, paints a bold portrait of a plant-based eating plan that is more likely to promote health than disease. The study can be considered the Grand Prix of epidemiology.”

I told them right off the bat that I wasn’t there to teach them how to cook—just to show them a few tricks to help them accommodate their vegan diners, like substituting heavy cream with cashew cream, or butter with Earth Balance. It was definitely a collaborative process over two years to come up with vegan dishes that fit each restaurant’s menu, from Italian to seafood.”

EVENT: In July, the American Dietetic Association, known since 2012 as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, issues its “Position on Vegetarianism,” which states, “It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.… The results of an evidence-based review showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease. Vegetarians also appear to have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. Features of a vegetarian diet that may reduce risk of chronic disease include lower intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy products, fiber, and phytochemicals.”

“While a plant-based diet has been associated with many health benefits—including a smaller risk of death from heart disease, lower LDL cholesterol levels, and a reduced incidence of diabetes, obesity and cancer—the diet has to be ‘appropriately planned,’ as the American Dietetic Association said in its recent position statement on the subject.”

“Think about it: Entire civilizations—in ancient Egypt, China and Mexico, for examples—were based on wheat, rice, beans or corn as sources of protein. Nutritionists used to believe that vegetarians had to carefully combine plant foods (beans and corn, for example), but now know that variety and calories take care of protein needs.”

For example, 80 percent of Americans consume insufficient fruit, 90 percent consume insufficient vegetables, and 99 percent consume insufficient whole grains. At the same time, overconsumption of solid fats, added sugars, and alcoholic beverages (all representing “empty calories”) is ubiquitous.

“Among the food groups, dark green vegetables, orange vegetables, legumes, and whole grains had the poorest showing, with nearly everyone in each sex-age group failing to meet recommendations.”

EVENT: In April, a Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) report indicates conflicts between U.S. dietary guidelines (which recommend eating more fruits and vegetables and less meat and dairy) and its agricultural policy, which channels 63 percent of taxpayer dollars directly or indirectly into meat and dairy production, 15 percent into sugar/starch/oil/alcohol production, and less than 1 percent to fruit and vegetable production.

“As a physician, I urge you to shut down federal programs that pump billions of dollars into direct and indirect subsidies for meat, sugar, and other unhealthy products that are feeding record levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other health problems that kill and disable millions of Americans every year. Most taxpayers have no idea that they subsidize unhealthy foods.”

EVENT: Sixty-five-year-old former President William Jefferson Clinton (b. 1946), whose love of foods ranging from barbecue to hamburgers during his presidency was well known and who had undergone quadruple bypass surgery in 2004 and stent surgery in 2010, speaks out about his veganism, saying that his vegan diet led to his dropping twenty-four pounds. On CNN, Clinton credits his conversion to a low-fat, plant-based diet with inspiration from a number of doctors, including Dr. Dean Ornish, one of Clinton’s doctors for nearly two decades, and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., both of whom have promoted the ability of a whole-food, plant-based diet to prevent and even reverse heart disease.

EVENT: Independent filmmaker Lee Fulkerson’s documentary Forks Over Knives is released, examining the profound claim that “Most, if not all, of the degenerative diseases that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting our present menu of animal-based and processed foods.” The film features the personal odysseys of Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn. (Long-time vegetarian actress Kristen Bell credits the film with her decision to go vegan, stating, “Forks Over Knives outlines an extremely compelling approach to the prevention of heart disease and cancer.”) The following year, Forks Over Knives: The Cookbook by Del Sroufe is published.

“One of the more convincing, radical and politically volatile docus to come out of the burgeoning good-food genre, Forks Over Knives advocates quite convincingly for the adoption of a plant-based diet, the intent being the eradication of the diabetes, obesity and hypertension afflicting an increasing number of Americans.”

—JOHN ANDERSON, VARIETY (MAY 5, 2011)



“Because of the film Forks Over Knives, more people than ever are looking to try veganism. I’m happy to be a part of the Forks Over Knives Cookbook [whose dessert chapter she wrote], because the better people find vegan food, the more people will stay! Because of the low-fat guidelines, which I don’t typically adhere to, I enjoyed rising to the challenge of using nut butters and avocado as fats, which helped to make the desserts really taste like desserts.”

EVENT: In May, Microsoft founder Bill Gates sings the praises of companies pursuing plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy, saying, “Companies that are taking the animal products… and actually coming up with a way of using largely plant-based materials—soy, peas, a variety of things—to make these things that are both cheaper, probably more healthy, less cruelty involved, less greenhouse gas emissions.” In 2013, his slideshow on “The Future of Food” extols the companies Beyond Meat and Beyond Eggs.

“[Moving toward a vegetarian diet is] important, too, in light of the environmental impacts of large-scale meat and dairy production, with livestock estimated to produce nearly 51 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases.… Flavor and texture have been the biggest hurdles for most people in adopting meat alternatives. But companies like Beyond Meat, Hampton Creek Foods and Lyrical are doing some amazing things. Their actual recipes are secret, but the science is straightforward. By using pressure and precisely heating and cooling oils and plant proteins (like powdered soybeans and vegetable fiber), you can achieve the perfect flavor and texture of meat or eggs. I tasted Beyond Meat’s chicken alternative, for example, and honestly couldn’t tell it from real chicken.”

“Almost all segments of the U.S. population have similar percentages of vegetarians, suggesting that most stereotypes of who is and is not the typical vegetarian in American society have little basis in fact. The biggest distinction seems to come in terms of marital status. Unmarried adults are more than twice as likely as married adults to be vegetarians.… Vegans apparently view themselves as different from, rather than a subset of, vegetarians; most of the small number of respondents in the survey who said ‘yes’ to the vegan question had said ‘no’ to the vegetarian question.”

EVENT: On December 4, the Intelligence Squared debate “Don’t Eat Anything with a Face” airs live on National Public Radio (see sidebar), with the team arguing “for”—PCRM’s Dr. Neal Barnard and Farm Sanctuary’s Gene Baur—declared the winner.





A CONVERSATION WITH DR. NEAL BARNARD


“According to a 2009 poll, around 1% of American adults reported eating no animal products [i.e., eating a vegan diet]. In 2011 that number rose to 2.5%—more than double, but still dwarfed by the 48% who [then] reported eating meat, fish, or poultry at all of their meals. In this country, most of us are blessed with an abundance of food and food choices. So taking into account our health, the environment, and ethical concerns, which diet is best? Are we or aren’t we meant to be carnivores?”

—INTELLIGENCESQUAREDUS.ORG


NPR hosted a live debate titled “Don’t Eat Anything With a Face” in front of an audience of more than 400 guests (including me) on December 4, 2013, airing nationally as part of its award-winning Intelligence Squared (IQ2) series and moderated by ABC News correspondent John Donovan.

Clinical researcher Neal Barnard, MD, the bestselling author of such books as Power Foods for the Brain and Dr. Neal Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes and founder and president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), joined Farm Sanctuary co-founder Gene Baur to argue for the proposition while researcher/blogger Chris Masterjohn and farmer/author Joel Salatin argued against it.

Audience members were polled electronically both before and after the debate, with each side’s aim being to persuade more voters to shift their position. In the pre-debate poll, 24% of the audience were for, 51% against, and 25% undecided. In the post-debate poll, 45% were for, 43% against, and 12% undecided—with the “for” team declared the winner.

I spoke with Dr. Barnard during the week following his team’s triumphant performance. Here are some of his thoughts:

“When the initial pre-vote was announced, it was very much against us. During the debate, there was a lot of applause for the other side—so I honestly couldn’t tell which way things were going. It was good to see things went the way they did.

“The outcome fits with the times, in a way. Looking at ethical side of things, over the past year or two chimpanzees were basically retired from medical research. Over the past two or three months, people have been giving a lot of attention to orcas and the controversy over SeaWorld [in the wake of the October 2013 premiere of Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s documentary Blackfish on CNN]. People are thinking about animals in a way they never did before. Over the past four or five years, climate change has started transitioning from being controversial to being accepted—and the animal part of that may not yet be at the forefront of people’s minds, but it’s there. And then it seems that every day a new celebrity announces that he or she is going vegan. So, the times do seem to be changing.”





ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS


“While the environmental arguments are quite accurate, most people find them a little too abstract—and they can’t quite use them as a motivator. There’s a diffusion of responsibility, so people think, “This steak that I’m eating isn’t going to affect things very much.” But of course if you put all of the cows in the United States on one side of a balance, and you put all of the people on the other side of the balance, the cows’ mass is much greater than ours. Every last cow is as big as a sofa, exhaling methane hour by hour. And for climate change, that’s a big issue.”





HEALTH CONCERNS


“Health arguments cast a much wider net. People want to lose weight, get their cholesterol down, improve their diabetes, improve their skin, or whatever. However, often people’s commitment to it might be ‘thinner’ than it is if they come to it through an ethical standpoint. If a person feels they can’t eat a chicken leg because they’re eating a living being, that’s not something they’re going to cheat on during the holidays; it’s grotesque no matter what day it is. If a person thinks they’re only doing it for their blood pressure, they may not be so committed. But even that’s not entirely true, because I see a lot of folks who felt that shifting to a vegan diet has absolutely saved their lives, so there’s no way they’re going to cheat on it.

“For older folks—say, over 50—who get news from their doctor that their blood pressure and everything else is not so hot, health issues are bigger for them just in general. Almost invariably, when people go vegan for health reasons, after about a month or so, somebody will say, ‘It just hit me what a weird diet most people eat—they’re eating animals all day!’ So the animal issues start kicking in to them, or they start to get the environmental part. No matter which door a person walks in, eventually the others start to make sense to them, too. [Bestselling author Dr.] John McDougall initially followed a vegan diet only for health—however, a year or so ago, I heard him say, ‘After a while, the animal part starts to make sense.’ ”





ETHICAL ISSUES


“I recognize that if you’re 16 years old, you’re not worried about prostate cancer. Sometimes it’s environmental issues, sometimes it’s health issues, but very often it’s animal issues that well up for young people.

“People are extremely physically perceptive in many ways. Humans have eyes that can detect color, whereas cats and dogs really don’t do that very well. On the other hand, animals are more perceptive in different ways. They have better hearing, for example, and a much better sense of smell. There are dogs who can sniff out cancer. However, people are amazingly imperceptive in relation to the feelings of others. A human being can barely sniff out what another person is thinking when they look into their eyes. I think that we specifically and intentionally don’t see things when they’re pointed out, like the fact that this is actually slaughtering an animal, and not ‘dressing’ them [a euphemism used by the opposing team during the IQ2 debate].

“Dairy is the same way. For many years, I consumed dairy products. Of course there are many health reasons to get away from it—it’s the biggest source of bad fat. But the ethical reasons against dairy are extremely profound. Cows stop producing milk very soon after giving birth, just as lactating women do. So to keep the cows lactating, farmers artificially inseminate them year after year. Half the offspring are male, and what do you do with a male dairy cow? You put him in a veal crate. No civilized person would eat veal—but veal will still be produced as long as there’s a dairy industry.”





THE PRACTICAL SIDE


“Eating vegan [which Barnard has done since 1984] is easier than it ever was. When I first went vegetarian in 1977, health food stores were tiny, dark little places playing folk music, where the cashiers were named Sunshine. The veggie burgers were kind of bready, and if you bought soy milk, it was a powder that you had to mix up like nonfat dried milk. But now when you go into health food stores, they are enormous—and they have every possible product you could ever want. It’s easy, and it’s everywhere.

“Everybody is different. There are some people who kind of drag themselves toward a vegetarian or vegan diet very slowly, while there are others who take to it instantly. There are some who need a lot of support, while others have no trouble at all. It’s like quitting smoking: There are some folks for whom it’s really rough, and there are others who say, ‘I’ve made up my mind—this is it.’ ”





MAXIMIZING FLAVOR:

CREATING A NEW, COMPASSIONATE CUISINE



“I had no idea so much flavor could be delivered without butter, cream, milk, eggs, and other kitchen staples. Chef Richard Landau’s staff must include a benevolent gremlin or a fairy godmother who sprinkles magic dust over the pots and the pans. I had trouble understanding how vegan food had advanced this far and this fast without an accompanying outpouring of acclaim.”

—ALAN RICHMAN, FIFTEEN-TIME JAMES BEARD AWARD–WINNING RESTAURANT CRITIC, IN GQ, NAMING VEDGE ONE OF 2013’s MOST OUTSTANDING RESTAURANTS




“I wasn’t trying to make vegan food. I was trying to make great food.… I still am a caveperson at heart who craves these carnal flame-roasted flavors, and that is what I have always cooked. My goal is to turn people on to what food can be once you take away all the labels.”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)



Throughout history, people have chosen vegetarianism for many reasons. The most common motivations fall into three primary categories: eating animals isn’t good for you (health), isn’t good for others (environment), and isn’t good, period (ethics). The current generation, however, appears to have pioneered a new reason for the shift away from meat and dairy products: maximizing flavor.

Terrance Brennan, whose twenty-year-old Manhattan restaurant, Picholine, has earned many accolades, including two stars from the Michelin Guide and three stars from the New York Times, and offers one of America’s best vegetarian tasting menus, described to me the process of perfecting his winter squash soup: “I switched from chicken stock to vegetable stock when I realized the flavor of the chicken stock was overpowering the flavor of the squash. And then I switched from vegetable stock to squash stock in order to intensify the squash flavor further,” he said. “And I didn’t stop there—I also came to realize that by adding cream to my squash soup, I was only diluting the flavor of the squash and not adding flavor, so I eliminated it.”



Wait—what? This classically French-trained chef, in the course of creating one of the best winter squash soups in America, had actually made it vegan?

This discovery reminded me of my surprise at learning, while researching The Flavor Bible in the mid-2000s, that French chef Michel Richard had eliminated the meat stock in his French onion soup and replaced it with miso broth, which he found brought as much if not more richness and umami to the soup without overpowering the flavor of the onions. In his 2006 book Happy in the Kitchen, Richard provides recipes for mushroom water and tomato water, which can be used as lighter, vegetarian alternatives to meat stock in sauces.

Just a few decades earlier, when the 1970s movement toward nouvelle cuisine saw a decrease in the use of butter and cream in French cooking, the continued use of meat stock appeared sacrosanct. However, with the publication of Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s groundbreaking 1990 book Simple Cuisine, his use of vegetable stocks, juices, and vinaigrettes in lieu of traditional stocks and sauces gained traction. “I have always been fascinated with the Mushroom Broth [made from caramelized white button mushrooms, shallots, garlic, parsley, and water] and its reduction, which, after a mere 30 minutes, closely resembles a veal stock,” Vongerichten writes in its pages, “and, if reduced further [another 10 minutes, when it becomes a syrup], a veal demi-glace that would take a day to prepare.” The world-renowned chef has since opened Manhattan’s vegetable-centric ABC Kitchen, which serves a deliciously crusty falafel-inspired veggie burger, and Vongerichten has announced plans to open a vegetarian restaurant in 2014.

Likewise, Daniel Boulud’s restaurant menus have always emphasized vegetables. New York’s Café Boulud has long highlighted dishes inspired by the farmer’s market under the heading “Le Potager.” After a 2013 redesign, Boulud’s db Bistro Moderne reopened with a new “Cuisine du Marché” section of the menu that is mostly vegetarian, including a db market salad with kohlrabi and radish and a dish of salt-baked celery root with wild mushrooms, apple confit, and toasted barley jus. His eponymous restaurant DANIEL (one of Restaurant magazine’s “World’s 50 Best Restaurants”) is also vegetarian-friendly and has offered a vegetarian tasting menu since the 1990s. Its November 2013 vegetarian menu included such flavor-rich dishes as lentil velouté with root vegetables, Orleans mustard cream, chive oil, and watercress; and glazed butternut squash with roasted black radish, pumpkin seed oil, and mustard salad.

Indeed, more restaurants from coast to coast and around the world (from Calgary to London to Sydney) have been offering vegetarian tasting menus, making this one of the fastest-growing trends in the industry. Today, it’s virtually expected that every city’s very best restaurants—such as DANIEL, Eleven Madison Park, and Per Se in New York City; CityZen, the Inn at Little Washington, and Komi in the Washington, DC, area; and Mélisse in the Los Angeles area—will accommodate vegetarian and vegan guests. Many kitchens of the elite Relais & Châteaux–affiliated restaurants throughout North America have gone to great lengths to please their vegetarian guests, including Camden Harbour Inn in Maine, Canoe Bay in Wisconsin, Fearrington House Restaurant in North Carolina, Hotel Fauchère in Pennsylvania, Lake Placid Lodge and The Point in New York, and Winvian in Connecticut.

Leading destination spas have also been on top of this trend for years. Rancho La Puerta in Mexico is well known for its mostly vegetarian cuisine, including a signature version of guacamole whose flavor is lightened and enhanced by the addition of pureed green peas (or alternatively asparagus, broccoli, or edamame). Its California sister property the Golden Door’s longtime chef Michel Stroot, who was the first spa chef nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award, has long insisted, “I want my asparagus soup to taste like asparagus—not cream, not butter, not chicken broth. You don’t need butter or cream when you have freshness and intensely flavored ingredients.”

The Lodge at Woodloch in Pennsylvania, which has its own vegetable and herb gardens (plus master herbalist Nathaniel Whitmore, who waxes lyrical to guests on the health benefits of herbs), inevitably offers at least one veg option on its dinner menu, with many more available during breakfast and lunch. Nate Curtis, chef of Rowland’s at the Westglow Resort & Spa in North Carolina, handcrafted two completely different vegetarian tasting menus for us during the first night of our visit, highlighted by two completely different tofu entrees: pesto-marinated tofu with root vegetable risotto, verjus-braised squash pudding, and pecan tuile; and black garlic–marinated grilled tofu with bamboo rice, orange kanzuri broth, radish slaw, and soy sauce. (Nate’s Southern-inspired veg menu the next night kicked off with a whimsical spin on the regional specialty fried pickles.)

A number of high-end chefs are turning their talents to bringing a new level of vegetarian food to supermarket aisles. In 2013, Dan Barber came out with a line of Blue Hill savory yogurts from milk from grass-fed cows; flavors include beet, butternut squash, carrot, parsnip, sweet potato, and tomato and are sold at retailers such as Whole Foods. Diane Forley (who apprenticed with Michel Guérard, Gaston Lenôtre, and Alain Passard before opening her restaurant Verbena) teamed with her chef-husband, Michael Otsuka (who had apprenticed with Michel Bras and Jacques Maximin), in 2009 to create Flourish Baking Company, which offers top-of-the-line pot pies and other baked goods “with a savory twist”—not to mention fresh vegetables, vegetable infusions, and organic whole grains, ensuring equal attention to nutrition and flavor.



There has been a national explosion in vegan bakeries (e.g., BabyCakes, Dun-Well Doughnuts, and Vegan Divas in New York City; Pomegranate Café in Phoenix; Petunia’s Pies & Pastries and Sweetpea Baking Co. in Portland, OR; Sticky Fingers in Washington, DC; Vegan Treats in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania), confectionaries (e.g., Chalk Hill Cookery in Healdburg, CA; Lagusta’s Luscious in New Paltz, NY; Sweet & Sara in Long Island City, NY), food trucks (e.g., Cinnamon Snail in New York City; Homegrown Smoker Vegan BBQ in Portland, OR; and that of Plum Bistro in Seattle, funded via a Kickstarter campaign), and ice cream shops (e.g., FoMu in Boston; Blythe Anne’s in New York City; Maddy’s in Los Angeles). The food they’re turning out is so decadently delicious that it’s winning over non-vegan customers, too—contributing to owners’ reticence to use the monikers “vegan” or “vegetarian” for fear they might turn off potential customers who could be easily won over on the basis of flavor alone.





VEGETARIAN FOOD FAST


It isn’t just higher-end places that are finding new ways of extolling the flavor of veg cuisine: In 2013, Chipotle Mexican Grill started testing an organic, non-GMO vegan option called “Sofritas.” Made from shredded tofu braised with chipotle chiles, roasted poblanos, and spices, it has a texture akin to ground meat and can be added to the chain’s burritos, tacos, bowls, and salads. (Chipotle’s previous test of Garden Blend, a grain-based protein, didn’t lead to a national roll-out.) Shortly before, the company had eliminated the bacon from its pinto beans, with a Chipotle spokesperson telling Consumerist.com, “In testing some recipes, we simply didn’t think the bacon added anything and, by removing it, we make the pinto beans vegetarian.”





FIVE TRENDS INTERSECTING TO FORGE A NEW, COMPASSIONATE CUISINE


“I have long thought of the food at the restaurant as vegetable-driven cuisine where, besides outright vegetarian dishes, the preparations derive much of their identity and character from a liberal use of vegetables, herbs, and grains.… It boils down to preserving clean, explosive flavors—flavors that maintain their integrity and elegance.”

—CHARLIE TROTTER OF CHARLIE TROTTER’S, WHICH HAS BEEN CREDITED AS THE FIRST CHICAGO RESTAURANT AND ONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN RESTAURANTS TO OFFER A VEGETARIAN TASTING MENU



A number of trends are coalescing to create a new, contemporary way of cooking and eating that sacrifices neither deliciousness nor wholesomeness. My prediction? The coming decade will see the evolution of a new, compassionate cuisine that represents the intersection of the following:

vegetarianism

health

globalization

gastronomy

flavor





VEGETARIANISM: FROM THE MARGINS TO THE MAINSTREAM


“Probably 70 percent of our dishes are vegetarian. We’re moving away from all the meat.”

—DANIEL HUMM OF ELEVEN MADISON PARK, TO GRUBSTREET.COM




“Generally speaking, you’re looking at 70 to 80 percent vegetables or grains [on Blue Hill’s menu] now.”

—DAN BARBER OF BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS, TO BLOOMBERG.COM



While the percentage of committed vegetarians has remained steady since 1999, the past fifteen years have seen bursts of growth in both more stringent veganism and less stringent flexitarianism. Together, this has fueled a 22 percent rise in vegetarian dishes on American restaurant menus from 2012 to 2013, as reported by Nation’s Restaurant News. Many of America’s best high-end restaurants—such as Eleven Madison Park and Blue Hill—appear to be naturally downshifting the amount of meat they’re serving as their cuisines evolve. And many are also making a pointed effort to promote “Meatless Mondays” at their restaurants (see here).

Centuries after Asian Buddhist monks began their development of some of the world’s first meat analogs—based on soy or wheat gluten, and approximating the appearance, texture, and flavor of various meats (including beef, chicken, duck, pork, and shrimp)—these non-animal proteins went mainstream in the U.S. through the advent of vegetarian Asian restaurants such as New York’s Zen Palate, as well as wholesale suppliers such as May Wah. Other meat, dairy, and egg alternatives that have hit the mainstream are not likely to leave supermarket shelves or the menus of vegetarian and vegan restaurants anytime soon.

The number of dedicated vegetarian and vegan restaurants has also grown at all points along the spectrum, from quick-service and fast-casual chains (e.g., Maoz Vegetarian, Native Foods, and Veggie Grill, the last of which characterizes 90 percent of its customers as omnivores looking to reduce their meat intake through its vegan “Chickin’ ” sandwiches and vegan “carne” asada) to casual-to-midscale spots (e.g., Blossom, Café Blossom, and the Candle Cafes in New York City; Café Gratitude, Gracias Madre, and Real Food Daily in Los Angeles; Root near Boston) to upscale restaurants (e.g., Candle 79 in New York City; Greens and Millennium in San Francisco). These represent a wide range of approaches to meatless cuisine, from naturally homey (e.g., Garden Café in Woodstock; Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca, New York; and Follow Your Heart near Los Angeles) to diner delights (e.g., Champs in Brooklyn, Chicago Diner in Chicago) to sophisticated (e.g., Crossroads in Los Angeles, Dirt Candy in New York City, Green Zebra in Chicago, Vedge in Philadelphia), and from vegetarian to vegan to raw vegan (e.g., G-Zen in Branford, Connecticut, and M.A.K.E. in Santa Monica).





HEALTH: AN OLDER POPULATION GROWS WISER


“As of 2010, diet surpassed smoking as the No. 1 risk factor for disease and death in America.”

—MICHAEL MOSS, WRITING IN A NOVEMBER 3, 2013, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE COVER STORY ON BROCCOLI



As this book’s Introduction suggests, Americans are finally waking up to the importance of diet and allowing health concerns to reshape what we eat—moving away from meat, eggs, and dairy (not to mention refined and processed foods, and often added salt, sugar, and fat), and increasingly toward a nutrient-dense, whole-food, plant-strong diet. With the aging of the population, we’re getting not only older but wiser—and increasingly seeking out food that’s as healthful as it is delicious.





MEATLESS MONDAYS


“As I started to question what I ate, I realized I ate meat simply because I always had. That didn’t seem like a good enough reason.”

—JOHN FRASER OF DOVETAIL, A NEW YORK TIMES THREE-STAR RESTAURANT OFFERING VEGETARIAN AND VEGETABLE-FOCUSED “MEATLESS MONDAY” MENUS (NEW YORK CITY)

As of February 2014, more than two hundred restaurants were participating in the Meatless Monday program by agreeing to spotlight the meatless dishes on their menus, including

Almond (East Hampton and NYC)

Babbo (NYC)

Benson Brewery (Omaha)

Border Grill (Las Vegas and Los Angeles)

Canyon Ranch (Tucson)

Casa Mono (NYC)

Cookshop (NYC)

Del Posto (NYC)

Dell’Anima (NYC)

Dovetail (NYC)

Gurney’s Inn (Montauk, NY)

Hard Rock Café (London)

Lupa (NYC)

M Café (Los Angeles)

Matsuhisa (Aspen)

Osteria Mozza (Los Angeles)

Pizzeria Mozza (Los Angeles)

SD26 (NYC)

Matthew Kenney found that his classical French training, with its layering of “fat on fat,” was “anti-flavor”: “It masked the flavor of the ingredients, and eating it didn’t make me feel good,” he recalls of the period before his evolution toward an olive oil–based, Mediterranean style of cooking. Then, in his thirties, he found himself sensitive to the way food made him feel and started eating less animal protein. But it was his transition to eating only vegetarian and raw food that he found life-changing. “My aches and pains went away,” he recalls. “I looked and felt younger. And as a chef, this new way of eating and preparing food reignited my passion.”

Kenney went on to open a number of raw-food restaurants, including Manhattan’s Pure Food & Wine (with then-partner Sarma Melngailis) in 2004 and Santa Monica’s M.A.K.E. in 2012, not to mention raw-foods academies in Miami, New England, and Santa Monica. “Most of the food being served in the world is so outdated—it’s more harmful than helpful to people’s health,” Kenney observes. “There’s definitely a correlation between a Bacchanalian approach to food and ill health. But I believe health and wellness and the culinary arts should be friends, not foes. You should not have to compromise.”





GLOBALIZATION: A SHRINKING WORLD’S EXPANDING CHOICES


“The pork-loving chef [David Chang], whose menu once read, ‘We do not serve vegetarian-friendly items here,’… has become obsessed with vegetables.… Chang couldn’t believe dishes prepared without meat, onions, or garlic could have such intense flavor.”

—GISELA WILLIAMS, WRITING IN FOOD & WINE (MARCH 2011) OF CHANG’S EYE-OPENING VISIT TO SOUTH KOREA TO EXPERIENCE THE VEGETARIAN BUDDHIST TEMPLE CUISINE PREPARED BY MONKS AND NUNS, ON THE HEELS OF SERVING A MEATLESS SUMMER VEGETABLE DINNER AT THE JAMES BEARD HOUSE ON AUGUST 20, 2009



As people from all corners of the earth come together to address the problems facing the planet, they are also embracing the diversity of cuisines from around the globe. Food has long been a portable embodiment of culture and a key driver of globalization (think of the spice routes), which continues to expand the range of ingredients, cooking techniques, and flavor profiles of interest today. Long a global melting pot, the United States is the world’s largest spice importer and consumer and has seen spice consumption grow nearly three times as fast as the population over the past decade. Ten years ago, an average American spice rack might have a mere ten spices; it now has forty.

Patty Penzey Erd, who owns The Spice House in the greater Chicago area with her husband, Tom, counts a long list of seasonings that her store couldn’t sell ten years ago and that it can barely keep in stock today, such as asafoetida powder, curry leaves, epazote, mango powder, pomegranate molasses, and tamarind. “These are all things that pair better with vegetarian dishes than with meat dishes, for the most part,” she observes. “Also, curries sell so much more than they ever did before, along with our garam masala mixture, and both work beautifully with vegetable dishes. Last night I attended a dinner for [Milwaukee chef] Sandy D’Amato at [Carrie Nahabedian’s Chicago restaurant] NAHA, where my favorite dish was the garam masala–spiced kohlrabi soup with tamarind-glazed almonds.”

Our evolving cuisine reflects our ongoing incorporation of these spices—in authentic, contemporized, and even melded (i.e., fusion) dishes. As The Flavor Bible points out, cuisine is undergoing a startling historic transformation: with the advent of the global availability of ingredients, dishes are no longer based on geography but on flavor. This radical shift calls for a new approach to cooking—as well as a new genre of vegetarian “cookbook” that serves not to document classic dishes via recipes but to inspire the creation of new ones based on imaginative and harmonious flavor combinations. Thus the book you hold in your hands.





THE VEGETARIAN KITCHEN: ONE WITHOUT BORDERS


“With optimum cooking and seasoning, vegetables have a capacity for flavor that meat simply doesn’t have. If legumes and grains are the backbone of Indian cuisine, vegetables provide the flesh. What we do in India with a plant-based diet that is different from other places is we add flavors in the beginning of cooking, before the vegetables, taking a little oil and adding cumin, coriander, mustard, cinnamon.… With an arsenal of flavorings that are easy to keep all year long, we are able to take boring greens and gnarly root vegetables and make them shine at the table and dance on your tongue.”

—SUVIR SARAN, CHEF AND AUTHOR OF AMERICAN MASALA (2007) AND MASALA FARM (2011)

There’s an entire world of vegetarian cuisine far beyond the bland brown-rice-and-kale fare many omnivores still mistakenly believe defines it. Countries, their customs, and their cuisines are inextricably linked, with each country or region offering its own take on delicious dishes based on vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds—which collectively suggest a world of endless possibilities. Mollie Katzen was a folk-dancing aficionado who traveled to folk festivals where she fell in love with a new world of foods—which is how she ended up tasting her first hummus, tabbouleh, and other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes that would become staples of her vegetarian kitchen and bestselling cookbooks (including the original Moosewood Cookbook, which features more than seventy recipes for dishes like mushroom moussaka, spinach-ricotta pie, and “soy gevult”). Others have drawn their inspiration from different parts of the globe, and I count myself lucky to be able to relish them all on a regular basis from my home base in Manhattan.

Restaurants serving Caribbean cuisine often feature vegetarian options. Believing that human beings are natural vegetarians based on anatomy and physiology and that “you are what you eat,” Jamaica’s Rastafarians opt for only those foods they see as enhancing vitality (the root of the word “ital” used to describe their cuisine). They eat close to nature, often seasoning their food with peppers (and sometimes the herb marijuana, as Indonesians do). I was utterly charmed by the cafeteria-style vegan restaurant Fire & Spice in Hartford, which I lucked into visiting after a Yelp search from nearby Interstate 84; its coconut-milk-enhanced chayote was incredible.

You can almost always find vegetable dishes on Chinese restaurant menus. Those favoring Cantonese-style cuisine should seek out Buddha Bodai (and especially its watercress dumplings and its impressive vegan barbecued “pork”) and the Vegetarian Dim Sum House in Manhattan’s Chinatown. My favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant was Hunan Manor, which I started frequenting weekly after being turned on to it by qigong master Robert Peng, who confided at a dinner party that—at that time—it was the restaurant whose food most reminded him of home. Two of my favorite dishes there were the Chinese long beans and eggplant over brown rice, as well as the bean curd with mixed vegetables in black bean sauce.

I’ve enjoyed Ethiopian cuisine since college, but I love it even more now as a fun way of eating vegetarian. Because of the culture’s traditional periods of fasting and avoiding meat, eggs, and dairy, every Ethiopian restaurant I know has a vegetarian combination option that includes the spongy pancakes called injera, which are used to scoop up bites of various braised legumes, greens, and other vegetables.

Indian cuisine isn’t an imitation or approximation of an earlier meat-based cuisine—it is an original vegetarian cuisine. Hindus, Jains, and Taoists all advocate vegetarianism, either loosely or strictly, and India is said to have the highest percentage of practicing vegetarians of any country in the world, making Indian restaurants one of the safest bets for vegetarian dining. I’m fortunate to live just a few blocks from Hemant Mathur’s Tulsi, one of the best Indian restaurants in America, and I am confident its ranks will be joined by Suvir Saran’s new San Francisco restaurant (as Saran and Mathur were partners in New York’s Devi, the first Indian restaurant in the U.S. to earn a Michelin star).

Not only did Indonesian cuisine give us tempeh, but its restaurants also invariably offer vegetarian options. Bali Nusa Indah in Manhattan’s Theater District offers several vegetarian combinations showcasing dishes such as coconut-milk-based vegetable stews, corn fritters, and gado gado (peanut sauce over assorted vegetables).

Kosher Israeli restaurants do not serve meat and dairy together, so you can be confident that dishes served in kosher dairy restaurants do not contain meat (although you should confirm that they do not contain fish, which is not considered meat under Jewish dietary laws). Roughly 8.5 percent of Israel’s population opts for vegetarianism, and veganism has been on the rise there ever since Gary Yourofsky’s 2010 “Best Speech You Will Ever Hear” talk at Atlanta’s Georgia Tech was translated into twenty-seven languages and became the most-watched speech on YouTube in Israel.

Pastas and pizzas have long been vegetarian staples, but restaurants like Brooklyn’s Paulie Gee’s and Portland’s Portobello Vegan Trattoria are doing their part to make pizza a vegan staple, too. Now that we Americans have assimilated northern Italian cuisine via restaurants and cooking shows, more and more of us are prepared to make the leap to the idea of farro or other grains prepared in the style of risotto. Boulud Sud in New York City sets the bar for farrotto, while the version of wheatberry risotto we tasted in 2013 at Canoe Bay in Wisconsin (which featured multiple local cheeses and a Parmesan foam) inspired Andrew to duplicate and then elaborate on it at home several times since, using Lucky Dog Farm’s wonderful organic wheat berries.

Enthusiasts of Japanese cuisine welcomed Manhattan’s vegan Michelin-starred restaurant Kajitsu, which specializes in dinnertime tasting menus showcasing seasonal ingredients such as matsutake mushrooms (which are as prized in Japanese cuisine as white truffles are in Italian). Lunchtime is a great value; a composed tray might feature a main dish of ramen noodles seasoned with three different kinds of miso, or rice topped with bamboo shoots, alongside seasonal vegetable accents and perhaps a spring roll or yuba (tofu skin) filled with seasoned rice. Manhattan’s popular Beyond Sushi creates vegan sushi from ingredients such as “mighty mushrooms” served on a six-grain blend. The lovely organic vegan Japanese restaurant Shojin in Los Angeles is also worth a visit, for dishes like Apricot-Kale Salad with Soy Vinaigrette and Spicy “Tuna” and Avocado Dynamite Roll.

Several years ago, I silently balked when a friend, the psychic Fahrusha, suggested the informal Korean-inspired vegan restaurant Franchia for our lunch date—but after tasting its spicy mock duck salad and vegetable bibimbap, I became a regular customer years before I stopped eating meat in 2012. It’s the sister restaurant of the acclaimed, more formal Hangawi, which strives to achieve the Korean ideal of um and yang (yin and yang in Korean) through a healthy balanced menu of green vegetables and fruits (um) and root vegetables such as radishes, carrots, and potatoes (yang).

I first tasted Malaysian cuisine in Los Angeles in the company of restaurant critic Jonathan Gold. There could have been no better introduction to the delights of coconut milk, galangal, lemongrass-infused curries, and fried noodle dishes. Malaysian cuisine is based on three different cuisines: Chinese, Indian, and Malay, with more meatless options among menus influenced by the first two than the last. Manhattan has its own Michelin-starred Malaysian-influenced restaurant, Laut, near Union Square, which delights with vegetarian takes on classics such as masak kicap (seasoned with cinnamon, garlic, ginger, onions, shallots, star anise, and turmeric), Malaysian vegetable curries, and a banana-and-homemade-peanut-butter roti dessert it calls “the Elvis.”

I’ve been a fan of Manhattan’s oldest Mexican restaurant, El Parador Café, for two decades of its fifty-five years in business. (How can you not love a restaurant whose motto is “The answer is yes. What’s your question?”) And I discovered a year or two ago that it offers vegetarian salsa upon request (its standard warm salsa is not), along with an excellent vegetarian menu—and owner Alex Alejandro will substitute mushrooms in the restaurant’s chilaquiles to make the dish veg. After two decades of loving one of America’s most renowned Mexican restaurants—Chicago’s Frontera Grill—and later its sister restaurant, Topolobampo, I was surprised to discover that the latter, too, offers a vegetarian menu. It blew me away—especially chef Andres Padilla’s extraordinary chayote dish, the best I’ve ever tasted. The organic vegan Mexican restaurant Gracias Madre on Mission Street in San Francisco is a charmer, with specialties like butternut squash tamales and enchiladas con mole.

Middle Eastern cuisines (e.g., Israeli, Lebanese, Syrian, and Turkish) offer an abundance of vegetarian options, from stuffed grape leaves to countless spreads and grains. The Lebanese-inspired mujadara (green lentils + bulgur + fried onions) sandwich at Kalustyan’s in New York City has a cult following, and I’m definitely among the true believers. I had one of the best falafel sandwiches I’ve ever tasted at New York’s hole-in-the-wall Taïm, which also serves the fried eggplant and hummus sandwich known as sabich. The fast-growing vegetarian chains serving Middle Eastern food, such as Boston’s Clover and New York’s Maoz, attest to its deliciousness.

Southern / Soul food–influenced vegetarian spots win raves from coast to coast. I’ll never forget my disbelief that the macaroni and cheese at Everlasting Life Restaurant & Lounge in Washington, DC, was actually vegan—it’s the best version I’ve ever tasted. Then again, I’ve not yet tried the wildly popular original version of Mac and Yease (which features nutritional yeast) created by Plum Bistro’s Makini Howell’s parents at their two-decades-old vegan restaurant Quickie Too in Tacoma, but I can hardly wait.

Thanks to Buddhist beliefs, which influence an estimated 10 to 15 percent of the country to practice vegetarianism, Taiwanese restaurants typically offer many vegetarian options, often without garlic, leeks, and onions (reflecting Buddhist teachings against eating overstimulating foods). These include a variety of mock meats (such as ham, ribs, sausages, and seafood) as well as tofu, rice, noodles, and vegetables. Taiwan-born culinary consultant Yuki Chen has brought some of these influences to the pan-Asian vegan cuisine at Manhattan’s Gobo, whose website indicates that she originally developed them as “the mastermind behind the menu at Zen Palate.”

Restaurants featuring the cuisine of countries where Buddhism has significant numbers of followers are often vegetarian-friendly, with Thai restaurants a prime example. While it’s relatively easy to avoid most meat and dairy by sticking with vegetable curries or tofu pad thai, it’s sometimes a challenge to avoid the ubiquitous fish sauce seasoning—although naturally fermented Golden Mountain Seasoning Sauce, Thai (aka white) soy sauce, or fermented black bean sauce can be substituted.

Vietnamese restaurants often have vegetarian options, although you just as often have to watch out for the seemingly ever-present nuac cham (fish sauce) that flavors them. Manhattan’s Lan Cafe is 100 percent vegetarian, serving dishes such as the Vietnamese baguette sandwiches known as bánh mì, lemongrass seitan on rice vermicelli, and of course pho: Vietnamese noodle soup served here with mock beef and sprouts and seasoned with herbs and lime.

Other cuisines are certainly less veg-friendly by tradition. Given that French cuisine has long incorporated meat stocks and demi-glace as foundational ingredients, I was all the more impressed with the debut of Manhattan’s first French-inspired vegetarian restaurant, Table Verte, where Chef Ken Larsen served dishes such as vegan onion tarts (made with Earth Balance), plus a meatless cassoulet based on black and pinto beans, garlic, and shallots and seasoned with bay leaf, cardamom, chili powder, cumin, and thyme.





GASTRONOMY: SETTING A HIGHER BAR FOR HAUTE CUISINE


“The natural progression of my thinking over thirty years as a chef.”

—ALAIN PASSARD OF THE MICHELIN THREE-STAR RESTAURANT L’ARPÈGE, ON HIS 2001 DECISION TO FOCUS ON A TASTING OF VEGETABLES—“THE GRANDS CRUS DU POTAGER”—AS HIS SIGNATURE MENU




“When you take a custard into the savory realm, it’s much more versatile, happily taking on any number of flavor profiles.… As oils can be infused with herbs, so, too, can custards: a basil custard in tomato soup, for instance; a tarragon custard with diced orange as a refreshing opening course. Some of the cream in the custard can be replaced by a vegetable juice to lighten it and intensify the flavor.”

—THOMAS KELLER, IN HIS BOOK BOUCHON (2004)




“I never, ever eat anything for health reasons. I eat for taste,” says Rene Redzepi… [of] Noma, otherwise known as the best restaurant in the world.… [H]e offered to help with my remedial education. Beginning with this: The reason we should eat our vegetables isn’t because they’re better for us. We should be plucking and pan roasting our friends in the plant kingdom, first and foremost, because they are damned delicious.”

—ADAM SACHS, BON APPÉTIT (DECEMBER 2012)



Gastronomy has been described by philosopher Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin as “the rational study of all related to man as he is eating; its purpose is to keep humankind alive with the best possible food.” It all comes down to two things: the ingredients themselves and the techniques with which they are prepared.

The variety and quality of ingredients available in the United States took a giant leap forward after Alice Waters opened the doors of Chez Panisse in 1971 and then decided that she wasn’t going to settle for sub-par ingredients. In rejecting industrialized food, she launched a revolution—and a new food economy—by developing direct relationships with farmers and other suppliers. Recent decades have seen the rise of specialty producers such as the Chef’s Garden in Ohio and Chino Farms in California and the explosive growth of farmers markets and community-supported agriculture (CSA). Vegetables are clearly eclipsing meat as the new stars of the plate and palate.

Diane Forley, whose 2002 book The Anatomy of a Dish chronicled her botanical approach to cooking and delineated the family trees of various vegetables (a theme later taken up in Deborah Madison’s 2013 Vegetable Literacy), observes how many vegetables thought to be odd twenty years ago are considered commonplace today. “Lots of nutritious plants are starting to be popular, like purslane, nettles, miner’s lettuce, and things previously thought of as ‘weeds,’ ” she observes. “And root vegetables like parsley root and kohlrabi are just not considered unusual anymore.”

Long-time chef of the vegetarian Greens Restaurant in San Francisco Annie Somerville has noted, “When most people don’t like a vegetable, it’s typically for one of three reasons: It’s overcooked, it’s undercooked, or it’s under-seasoned.” Over the years, chefs have learned how to cook and season vegetables for maximum flavor, drawing on the principles of flavor compatibility and leveraging classic flavor pairings while forging new ones.





AARON WOO OF PORTLAND’S NATURAL SELECTION ON CREATING DEPTH OF FLAVOR


“The challenge in vegetable-based cooking is finding depth of flavor. I don’t ever want people to get bored eating one of our dishes. We attack things in regard to texture, because that is the single primary way to get bored: having everything the same texture, regardless of how flavorful it is. Then we use all of our techniques to give each vegetable a different profile.

“Today, we have a lot more going for us than we did ten years ago; we dehydrate, roast, sauté, or char. When charring vegetables, such as ramps or fennel, we roast them at 300 to 400 degrees in the oven for however long is appropriate, and it slowly changes the flavor profile. Then we puree them to create ash to use as a seasoning.

“By focusing on cooking vegetables, I think more about flavor than I ever have before in my cooking career, and I feel I am by far a better cook than I have ever been before in my life.”





Chefs like the late Charlie Trotter brought a new level of respect to vegetables, applying painstaking techniques previously reserved for animal-based ingredients and featuring them on the country’s first vegetarian tasting menus. “Alice Waters may have discovered vegetables, but [Charlie] Trotter was the first man I know who cooked them beautifully,” said Alan Richman in the March 29, 2011, New York Times. After Copenhagen’s Noma was named the world’s best restaurant in 2010, chef René Redzepi was lauded in Bon Appétit for “treating vegetables like meat: braising them, basting them, flavoring them with lots of herbs and butter (preferably that made from sweet, rich goat’s milk).”

Vegetarian cooks have long used blenders (such as immersion blenders and Vitamixes), dehydrators, juicers, smokers, and spiralizers. And after a decade of intense culinary experimentation inspired by Chef Ferran Adrià of Spain’s El Bulli restaurant (creating foams, gels, and caviar-like spheres), there is a new arsenal of culinary techniques being developed and employed to enhance flavor.

M.A.K.E.’s Matthew Kenney builds his dishes around vegetables but takes pains to explain, “It is not simply a pile of carrots. It will be carrots cooked sous-vide until tender, while others are raw and still others pickled. A dish will feature a wide variety of variations on an ingredient, with the foundation being fresh ingredients and any sauces simply enhancements.”

Tal Ronnen of Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles conducts master vegetarian workshops at Le Cordon Bleu, which shared his vegan adaptations of the five classic mother sauces of French cuisine (béchamel, espagnole, hollandaise, tomato, and velouté). “It was an elective for students and required for the whole staff on all nineteen campuses,” he recalls. “It was great because this is influencing literally hundreds of future chefs who would never have looked at vegan cuisine seriously. By the time the course was over, they saw vegan cuisine in a different light.”

As one the country’s most gifted vegan chefs, Ronnen is already elevating the vegan restaurant experience to a level never seen before. And as more of the world’s best restaurant chefs turn their own attention, talent, and creativity to vegetarian and even vegan menus, he and they are starting to demonstrate the true potential of plant-based cuisine.





FLAVOR: EXPLORING THE FLAVOR EQUATION


“Flavor profiles are really in the herbs or the vegetables, not the protein. That is what determines the character of the dish.”

—TOM COLICCHIO, TO STEPHANIE MARCH OF HAMPTONS MAGAZINE (NOVEMBER 2012)




“[When creating new dishes], I will choose an ingredient to focus on, and that is where The Flavor Bible comes in—I look for [a pairing] that is out of the ordinary, then I’ll come up with the other components that I want to use. Next, I’ll sit down with my sous chef and work it out in a collaborative, organic, and democratic process. I might come up with two parts [of a dish], hit a roadblock, and then talk to someone and open The Flavor Bible. Usually it is a matter of hitting on a single ingredient that will spark the dish into a different direction and make it all come together.”

VEGETARIAN SHOW-STOPPER DISH AT BETONY


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was Eleven Madison Park alum Bryce Shuman’s grain salad at New York City’s Betony, which won a three-star rave from Pete Wells of the New York Times shortly after opening. It’s deceivingly simple-looking: a smear of thick Greek yogurt on a plate, topped with mixed grains, which are in turn topped with a variety of sprouts. Knowing by its extraordinary flavor that there was a lot more to it, I had to ask Bryce to tell me about the secrets behind it.

That yogurt? It’s been pressed and strained until very thick, in order to anchor the grains on the plate. Those grains? They’re a combination of barley, bulgur, farro, quinoa, spelt, and wheat berries. Each is cooked separately—the bulgur and quinoa steamed, and the barley, farro, spelt, and wheat berries simmered. The grains are mixed, and half are dehydrated. The dehydrated grains are submerged (via a strainer) in very hot (450–470 degree) oil for literally one second, so that they puff—creating a crunchy texture. Finely chopped shallots and chives are added to the unpuffed mixed grains, which are seasoned with kosher salt and drizzled with lemon vinaigrette. The grains are then tossed with the puffed grains and placed on the yogurt base. Then they are draped with a combination of mostly clover sprouts, some pea sprouts, and a few mung bean sprouts, and finished with another drizzle of lemon vinaigrette.





Flavor stands at the center of the intersection of these trends, uniting them all. No matter what other factors come into play, it is a love of flavor that is leading chefs to explore new, meatless avenues of flavor enhancement. There’s an aspect of flavor that is intensely personal—and a reflection of one’s experiences, preferences, and values.





FLAVOR = TASTE + MOUTHFEEL + AROMA + “THE X FACTOR”


Taste = What we perceive via the taste buds

Mouthfeel = What we perceive via the rest of the mouth

Aroma = What we perceive via the nose

“The X Factor” = What we perceive via the other senses—plus the heart, mind, and spirit



Understanding flavor is just as important to vegetarian and vegan cooking as it is to any other style of cooking. The first chapter of The Flavor Bible (2008) outlines the basic principles of flavor. I am happy to recap these basics here and to expand upon them for the purposes of contemporary vegetarian cuisine.



Our taste buds perceive five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. The essence of good cooking is to bring these five tastes into balanced harmony to create deliciousness. It’s that simple—and that difficult. After all, flavor is a function of our other senses—that is, not only taste, but also smell, touch, sight, and hearing. And because we’re human beings, other nonphysical factors come into play, including our emotions, thoughts, and spirits.

Learning to recognize as well as manipulate both the obvious and subtle components of flavor will make you a much better cook. This book will be your companion in the kitchen whenever you wish to use plant-based ingredients to create deliciousness.

Everyone who cooks—or even merely seasons their food at the table before eating—can benefit from mastering the basic principles of making food taste great. This complex subject is simplified by one fact: while the universe may contain a vast number of ingredients and a virtually infinite number of ingredient combinations, the palate can register only the five basic tastes.

Great food balances these tastes beautifully. A great cook knows how to taste, to discern what is needed, and to make adjustments. Once you learn how to season and how to balance tastes, a whole new world opens up to you in cooking. Great cooking is never as simple as merely following a recipe. The best cooking requires a discerning palate to know when a dish needs a little something or other—and what to add or do to elevate the flavor.





WHAT WE PERCEIVE VIA THE MOUTH





TASTE


Sweet. Salty. Sour. Bitter. Umami. Every delicious bite you’ve ever tasted has been a result of these five tastes coming together on your taste buds. We taste them as individual notes and in concert. Each taste affects the other. For example, bitterness suppresses sweetness. In addition, different tastes affect us in different ways. Saltiness stimulates the appetite, while sweetness satiates it. Take the time to explore the five basic tastes, and you’ll find that they’re often influenced by factors such as freshness and ripeness, which are also helping to fuel the trend toward local cuisine.


Sweetness It takes the greatest quantity of a substance that is sweet (versus salty, sour, bitter, or umami) to register on our taste buds. However, we can appreciate the balance and “roundness” that even otherwise imperceptible sweetness adds to savory dishes. Sweetness can work with bitterness, sourness—even saltiness. Whether delivered via honey, maple syrup, molasses, sugar, or another ingredient, sweetness can also bring out the flavors of other foods, such as fruits and certain vegetables (e.g., tomatoes) and grains (e.g., oats).


Saltiness When (for our 1996 book, Culinary Artistry) Andrew and I banished more than thirty of America’s leading chefs to their own desert islands with only ten ingredients to cook with for the rest of their lives, the number-one ingredient they chose was salt. Salt is nature’s flavor enhancer. It is the single most important taste for making savory food delicious. (Sweetness, by the way, plays the same role in desserts). Salts flavored with smoke or truffles offer even more ways to enhance the flavor of soups or risottos, and New York City’s venerable spice store Kalustyan’s lists dozens of varieties on its website. Beyond salt, regionally appropriate salty ingredients also play an important role in enhancing veg meals, such as Parmesan cheese with dishes like pastas, pizzas, and risottos, and soy sauce and tamari with stir-fries and veg sushi.


Sourness Sourness is second only to salt in savory food and sweeteners in sweet food in its importance as a flavor enhancer. Sour notes—whether a squeeze of lemon or lime, or a drizzle of vinegar—add sparkle and brightness to a dish. Honing your choices for adding acidity, such as by selecting the right vinegar (whether apple cider vinegar for fruit salad, rice wine vinegar for nori rolls, or sherry vinegar for gazpacho) can enhance it even further. Balancing a dish’s acidity with its other tastes is critical to the dish’s ultimate success.


Bitterness Humans are most sensitive to bitterness, and our survival wiring allows us to recognize it in even relatively tiny amounts. Bitterness balances sweetness and can also play a vital role in cutting richness in a dish. For example, the bitterness of walnuts balances the sweetness of a beet salad while cutting the richness of the goat cheese that often accompanies it. Chocolate’s bitterness is an innate counterbalance in rich desserts. While bitterness is more important to certain people than to others, some chefs see it as an indispensible “cleansing” taste—one that makes you want to take the next bite, and the next.


Umami (Savoriness) In addition to the four original tastes, there is now widespread acceptance of a fifth taste, umami, which Andrew and I first wrote about in 1996 in Culinary Artistry. It is often described as the savory or meaty “mouth-filling” taste that is noticeable in such ingredients as aged cheese (e.g., blue, Parmesan), fermented foods (e.g., miso, sauerkraut), mushrooms, and sea vegetables, and in such flavorings as monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is the primary component of branded seasonings such as Acćent. Vegetarian dishes loaded with umami range from miso soup with shiitakes, tofu, and wakame to pastas with tomato sauce, mushrooms, and Parmesan cheese.





MOUTHFEEL


In addition to its sense of taste, the mouth has a sense of “touch” and can register other sensations, such as temperature and texture, that play a role in flavor. These aspects of food, generally characterized as mouthfeel, help to bring food into alignment with our bodies, and bring some of a dish’s greatest interest and pleasure. The crunchiness and crispiness of a dish contribute sound as well as textural appeal.


Temperature Temperature is one of the foremost among the other sensations that can be perceived by the mouth. The temperature of our food even affects our perception of its taste; for example, coldness suppresses sweetness. A food’s temperature can affect both the perception and enjoyment of a dish. A chilled carrot soup on a hot summer day—and hot roasted carrots on a cold winter day—could be said to be “healing” through their ability to bring our bodies into greater alignment with our environment.


Texture A food’s texture is central to its ability to captivate and please. We value pureed and/or creamy foods (such as soup and mashed potatoes) as “comfort” foods, and crunchy and crispy foods (such as nachos and caramel corn) as “fun” foods. We enjoy texture as it activates our other senses, including touch, sight, and sound.



While babies by necessity eat soft or pureed foods, most adults enjoy a variety of textures, particularly crispiness and crunchiness, which break up the smoothness of texture—or even the simple monotony—of dishes. At New York City’s Kajitsu restaurant, Chef Ryota Ueshima often incorporates a crispy tempura-fried element into his silky ramen or udon noodle dishes for a pleasing contrast in texture and flavor.

Much of the flavor of meat is conveyed by its texture, such as its chewiness (e.g., chicken) or its crispiness (e.g., crisp-fried bacon). It’s possible to approximate a similar texture with meatless ingredients (e.g., fried Provolone slices can approximate crispy bacon in a “vegetarian BLT”) or plant-based ingredients (e.g., lentils, whole grains, mushrooms, or frozen-then-cooked and crumbled tofu can approximate chewy ground beef, such as in tacos or chili, while thinly sliced crisp-fried tempeh can approximate bacon, e.g., in a club sandwich). In playful cuisine, caviar can be approximated via spherification, a chemical process introduced by Ferran Adrià at Spain’s El Bulli restaurant in 2003, which involves the creation of spherical caviar-like substances from calcium lactate mixed with sodium alginate and one’s choice of flavorings, from sea vegetables to watermelon.

Likewise, many people enjoy the creamy texture of milk and cream. These can be approximated by plant-based milks, such as those made from almonds, coconut, hazelnuts, hemp, oat, rice, and soy, or by plant-based creams such as cashew cream and coconut cream. If you haven’t yet tried some of the better vegan “ice creams” available, you’re in for a treat: you’ll be amazed by the silky, creamy texture of FoMu’s or Maddy’s ice creams or the commercially available Coconut Bliss nondairy frozen dessert.

For other examples of non-veg foods that can be approximated by vegetarian or vegan substitutes, check out “Getting to the Root of Cravings” on here.


Piquancy Our mouths can also sense what we often incorrectly refer to as “hotness,” meaning piquancy’s “sharpness” and/or “spiciness”—whether boldly as in chile peppers, or more subtly as in a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Some people find the experience of these picante (as the Spanish say, or piccante as the Italians do) tastes more pleasurable than others, and have varying levels of toleration—hence the “mild,” “medium,” “hot,” or “very hot” labels on many salsas. Mexican cuisine most famously celebrates chiles’ piquancy, although other cuisines—from Thai to Italian (in which you’ll commonly find garlicky broccoli rabe accented with a shake of chili pepper flakes)—do, too.


Astringency Our mouths pucker to register astringency. This is a drying sensation caused by the tannins in red wine or strong tea and occasionally in foods such as walnuts, cranberries, and unripe persimmons. The astringency of cranberries is often a welcome addition to sweeter apple and pear desserts such as pies or crisps, while a handful of astringent pomegranate seeds can add a refreshing counterbalance when sprinkled atop rich Mexican moles or Persian walnut sauces.





WHAT WE PERCEIVE VIA THE NOSE





AROMA


Aroma is thought to be responsible for 80 percent or more of flavor. This helps to explain the popularity of aromatic ingredients, from fresh herbs and spices to grated lemon zest. Incorporating aromatic ingredients can enhance the aroma of your dish and, in turn, its flavor.

While there are only five basic tastes, there is an almost infinite number of aromatic notes that contribute to the flavor of food. Most aromas can be characterized as either sweet or savory.

Sweet notes are largely associated with sweeteners, fruits, and certain vegetables (e.g., sweet potatoes), herbs (e.g., basil), and spices (e.g., cinnamon). Savory notes are typically associated with “meatiness” almost as much as with alliums such as garlic and onions, even across different cultures. Other savory notes can include cheesiness, smokiness, and spiciness. Cheesiness can even be found in vegan cuisine, such as in nutritional yeast, or in vegan cheeses. Smokiness can be imparted via cooking techniques (e.g., grilling, hot or cold smoking) and/or ingredients (e.g., smoked paprika, liquid smoke). And spiciness can reflect flavor chords that are regionally specific combinations of flavors (e.g., garlic + ginger + soy sauce = Asia; garlic + lemon + oregano = Mediterranean).

Some qualities are perceived through both taste and smell:


Pungency Pungency refers to the taste and aroma of ingredients, such as horseradish and mustard, that are as irritating—albeit often pleasantly—to the nose as they are to the palate. The simple sweetness of a beet soup can be punched up with a dollop of horseradish cream sauce, while bitter green salads often find mustard vinaigrettes a welcome enhancement.


Chemesthesis Chemesthesis refers to other sensations that tickle (e.g., the tingle of carbonated beverages) or play tricks on (e.g., the false perception of “heat” from chile peppers or “cold” from spearmint) our gustatory senses. Experimental chefs have had fun introducing sugar combined with carbon dioxide (commercially known as Pop Rocks) into high-end desserts, providing mini-explosions of flavor in the mouth.





WHAT WE PERCEIVE VIA THE OTHER SENSES, THE HEART, THE MIND, AND THE SPIRIT


“THE X FACTOR”


When we are conscious of and alert to what we are eating, food has the power to affect our entire selves. We experience food not only through our physical senses—including our sense of sight, which we address below—but also emotionally, mentally, and even spiritually.

The X Factor takes into consideration the fact that different people will perceive the same dish differently. For example, someone who grew up loving strawberries and someone who is allergic to strawberries will perceive the flavor of the same hypothetical “perfectly prepared” strawberry tart differently. Likewise, an omnivore and a vegetarian will perceive the aroma or flavor of the same hypothetical “perfectly prepared” meat stew differently.

When vegetarians or vegans say that they have “lost their taste for meat,” they don’t actually mean that their taste buds have changed, but that—physically, emotionally, mentally, and/or spiritually—they perceive its flavor as no longer palatable.





THE VISUAL


The visual presentation of a dish can greatly enhance the pleasure we derive from it. During the best vegan tasting menu of my life at Eleven Madison Park, I was as delighted by the visual presentation of the carrot tartare, which was ground before my eyes in a meat grinder temporarily attached to our table for this purpose, and accompanied with a palette of spices and herbs we could use to season it ourselves, as I was with its exquisite resulting flavor.



Just a few decades ago, it was still possible to taste a dish with the eyes, but only those who’d spent time in world-class kitchens knew the tricks of such artistic plate presentation or modern techniques. Since the widespread dissemination of photos of dishes from the world’s best restaurants via the Web, it’s become easier to reproduce a great dish’s elaborate form than its exquisite flavor.

How a dish looks can also affect our perception of its flavor in more direct ways; for example, the deeper the color of a berry sorbet, the more berry flavor is perceived. The stronger the connection between a particular food and a particular color, the stronger the flavor impact—such as raspberries and strawberries with red, lemon with yellow, and lime with green.





THE EMOTIONAL


“I say all the time that [my mother’s Spanish potato and egg tortilla] is my favorite because it conveys a point: that sentimental value comes above all else.”

—FERRAN ADRIÀ, FOUNDING CHEF OF EL BULLI (SPAIN)



We taste with our hearts as much as with our tongues. What else could explain adult preferences for one’s mother’s dishes over those prepared by a great chef? This also helps to explain the lasting appeal of traditional dishes and cuisines of countries around the globe, which stem from our love for their people, their cultures, and the deeply rooted culinary traditions that have sustained them over centuries.

I am in awe of the pivotal moment in the animated film Ratatouille, which is the single best on-screen depiction of the transformative power of food I’ve ever seen. Knowing that chef Thomas Keller had consulted on the design of the movie’s namesake dish, I found the flavor of the extraordinary ratatouille I was served during my veg tasting menu at Per Se in New York City all the more pleasurable.





THE MENTAL


If we ate only for sustenance, we might be able to survive on nutritive pills and water. But we also eat for pleasure. Because we typically eat three times a day, 365 days a year, we enjoy novelty, such as a twist on the traditional construct of a dish. Increasingly, since the 1980s and the advent of “tall” food, chefs have played with the presentation of their ingredients. Since the 1990s, the advent of avant-garde cuisine and so-called molecular gastronomy has seen chefs experiment more and more with both the chemical composition and presentation of dishes as well.

Conceptual dishes provide pleasurable “food for thought.” Chef Amanda Cohen of New York City’s Dirt Candy goes to great lengths, through a development process often lasting months, to reinvent fun vegetable-centric versions of meaty classics, smoking broccoli and nestling it into a hot dog bun to become a “Broccoli Dog” and subbing cornflake-crusted cauliflower for the namesake meat in a veg spin on chicken-and-waffles. And the Inn at Little Washington in Virginia, the site of some of the very best meals of my life, is well known for its signature dish “Portobello Mushrooms Pretending to Be a Filet Mignon.”





THE SPIRITUAL


The preparation, cooking, and eating of food is a sacrament. Treating it as such has the potential to elevate the quality of our daily lives as nothing else can. Several of the world’s leading chefs have worked to perfect each aspect of the dining encounter—from the food and drink to the ambiance to the service—to raise the overall experience to a new level imbued not only with pleasure, comfort, and interest, but also with meaning.





DR. NEAL BARNARD ON THE X FACTOR UNDERLYING CHEESE ADDICTION


“Part of some people’s addiction to cheese is physical. Back in 2003, the NIH [National Institutes of Health] funded us to do a diabetes study using a vegan diet. As the [diabetic] participants began to go vegan, they started losing weight, their blood sugars came down, and everything got better. But I noticed that a lot of them had what I might call food addictions. Some would specifically say, ‘I miss cheese.’ Not necessarily milk, and maybe not even ice cream, but cheese in particular. So I thought, ‘Why is that? It smells like old socks—why cheese?’

“There are a couple of things going on here. First, it turns out that there is a gene that causes some people to be born with too few dopamine receptors in their brains. If you have that DRD2 Taq1 allele, you have fewer dopamine receptors, and that means you don’t feel dopamine’s effects so much—so you need extra dopamine stimulation. So you might smoke, or drink, or get into compulsive gambling or compulsive eating. About half the people with type 2 diabetes have this gene that causes them to overeat—and it leads them to really want things that give them extra dopamine, particularly food.

“But cheese is a special case. Nutritionally, it is awful—with a very high content of saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, cheese is extremely high in casein, the dairy protein, which is not like other proteins. It breaks apart to release opiates into the bloodstream, and these mild casomorphins attach to the same opiate receptors in the brain that heroin attaches to, called the mu-receptor. So it’s not just taste, it’s not just mouthfeel—dairy products are unique in that they release casomorphins, and cheese has a much higher concentration of them than milk or ice cream.

“If I stuck a needle in your arm a half-hour after you ate cheese, there would be opiates in your bloodstream and attaching to your brain. While it’s not enough to make you drive dangerously or rob a convenience store, it’s enough to make you say the next day, ‘I think I’d like a little more cheese.’ Completely stinky, repugnant cheeses become attractive when a person associates what’s going on in the brain with the smell and the flavor.

“If you are hooked on cheese—or anything else—you might consider trying to make a clean break. That’s easier than teasing yourself with little bits here and there.”





TOWARD A MORE COMPASSIONATE CUISINE


“Will three or four meals [at Matthew Kenney’s Santa Monica raw foods restaurant, M.A.K.E.] be enough to sway a hardened raw-foods cynic? Of course not.… But it may be enough to make him take a second look.”

—PULITZER PRIZE–WINNING RESTAURANT CRITIC JONATHAN GOLD, WRITING IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES (APRIL 13, 2013)




“This is a chance for a personal revolution: to leave your mark on this planet by causing the least amount of harm possible. What’s the argument for not causing the least amount of harm? Inconvenience? Indifference? Apathy?… Here’s the coolest thing about being vegan in this day and age: It’s never been easier. You can have the same smell, taste, and texture of meat, cheese, and milk without it. Nobody has to suffer and die for dinner any more, including you.”

—GARY YOUROFSKY, THE VEGAN ACTIVIST WHOSE 2010 TALK AT GEORGIA TECH, TITLED “BEST SPEECH YOU WILL EVER HEAR,” BECAME A YOUTUBE SENSATION



Here at the crossroads of our history and our future, we have choices to make every day with every meal we make and eat. I hope that those choices will be more conscious, informed, and compassionate—for ourselves, for others, and for our planet.

In a recent Technomic poll, two out of three Americans agree that a vegetarian meal can be just as satisfying as a non-vegetarian one. My aim with this book is to help make that fraction even larger. Given the extraordinary talent that is being brought to the realm of plant-based cuisine via vegetarian and vegan menus and restaurants, I have no doubt that fraction will continue to grow.

“José Andrés, Mario Batali, and Tom Colicchio are all preaching that vegetables are the next big thing. They are really helping,” Rich Landau and Kate Jacoby of Vedge in Philadelphia observe. “They are not going vegan, or dressing up in cow suits with ‘Meat is Murder’ signs—they are just out there to say what is true: meat is getting boring, and vegetables are the most interesting food there is to cook. It is an amazing perspective and a great way to look at what is happening on our dining scene.”

It is easier than ever to eat vegetarian and even vegan today—and more are doing so. The easiest places I’ve ever tried to do so are New York City and Los Angeles, where there is an embarrassment of riches. The hardest was a suburb two hours east of Minneapolis, where we had to point out to our waitress at one of the “better” restaurants in town that our guacamole was served brown, and were informed, “It always comes out of the can that color.” But we found a little mom-and-pop southeast Asian restaurant in the same town, where we had wonderful veg dishes, so it just took a bit of perseverance.

I’d have imagined that Omaha (land of Omaha Steaks!) might be one of the very toughest. So I was shocked when I first heard that Brooklyn-based vegan cookbook queen Isa Chandra Moskowitz had moved there and was planning to open a vegan café, which underscored how widespread veg cuisine is becoming even outside major metropolitan areas. My eyes opened wider when VegNews named a dozen small towns notable for their vegan friendliness in 2013 and I saw that they included choices from north to south and from coast to coast, including Asheville, North Carolina; Ashland, Oregon; Athens, Georgia; Boulder, Colorado; Ithaca, New York; Portland, Maine; and Santa Cruz, California.

Tal Ronnen of Crossroads in Los Angeles takes it all in stride. “There is nothing that can surprise me anymore,” he told me. “Because this is not a trend or fad: It is something we are going to have to turn to sustain the future of our world. And I am looking forward to every day as it comes.”





FLAVOR COMPATIBILITY


An essential aspect of great cooking is harnessing compatible flavors—which involves knowing which herbs, spices, and other flavorings best accentuate particular ingredients.

A process of trial and error over centuries resulted in classic cuisines and dishes, some of which feature timeless combinations of beloved flavor pairings—for example, apples with cinnamon, bananas with rum, rice with soy sauce, tomatoes with basil, jícama with lime.

It’s fascinating to find that certain combinations of ingredients can fool us into believing we’re eating something other than what we’re actually eating because of their context. As a child of four or five, I once believed that the slice of pie I was eating with soft, layered sugar-and-cinnamon-scented filling was apple pie—and utterly shocked when I learned it was something called “mock apple pie” made with Ritz crackers standing in for sliced apples! The experience was so profound that it started me thinking about food more deeply at a very young age, and deconstructing what makes a dish that dish.

Mock apple pie isn’t such a far cry from the avant-garde creations of modernist kitchens that turn classic dishes on their heads. Homaro Cantu of Chicago’s moto has made the point that classic flavor combinations are what help make experimental dishes work, because they bring a sense of familiarity and comfort to the unfamiliar and novel. So, too, do they further veg interpretations of classic meat-based dishes, such as veg Reuben sandwiches, a cult dish that appears on countless vegetarian restaurant menus. By the time you put together rye bread, Thousand Island dressing, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut, the context has the eye so convinced that it is really a Reuben sandwich that the palate is more forgiving to the seasoned seitan, tempeh, or other stand-in for corned beef. Likewise, I was so enamored with the flavor and texture of Dave Anderson’s delicious mock tuna salad sandwich at Maddy’s in Los Angeles—with its chopped celery and Vegenaise served on fresh-baked ciabatta bread—that it was a cinch to get me to buy into the slight resemblance of mashed chickpeas to mashed canned tuna.





GETTING TO THE ROOT OF CRAVINGS


“People don’t really crave bacon—they crave something smoky and crispy. And they don’t really crave fish sauce—they crave that fermented umami flavor you can get from fermented black bean sauce.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)


“People associate a lot of flavor properties with meat that are due to the other umami-rich ingredients in a dish. If you put a heavy braised stew made with caramelized onions and tomato paste and red wine next to the same stew made without meat, you’d find virtually the same umami and richness in both.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)




“Most people think they want milk, cream, and cheese, when what they’re really craving is creaminess. If you sauté onions to caramelize them and puree them with vegetable stock and red wine, it mimics a creamy texture.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“I am not against soy, but we don’t cook tofu or seitan or reshape something into meat here. Nor do we serve fake cheese. Instead, we will try to give you the satisfaction your memory seeks whether it is texture, caramelization, or fat content. If I want to serve a creamy dish with the texture or voluptuousness that you might normally get from butter or cream, I will use root vegetables like carrots, parsnips, celery, or parsley and confit them. We’ll shave them really thin on the mandoline, then add some fat in the form of olive oil with herbs or citrus, and cook them at 85 degrees for six to eight hours, which breaks down the cell wall structure. I will add that I am not a scientist—I am just a cook—but [this approach] achieves everything you’re looking for.”

“I typically don’t like fake anything and believe in cooking from scratch. We didn’t like any of the premade veggie burger patties we tried, and only make our own. But realizing that Buddhists have been making faux meats for ages, we’ve found some to be very good. For example, May Wah Vegetarian Market’s ‘chicken’ has amazing flavor and texture. It’s great broiled, because it gets crispy and has a nice stringy texture, but I probably wouldn’t use it for a cold chicken salad.… And while Tofutti sour cream has a texture that’s a bit stiff, I’ve enjoyed it in soups like borscht or on potato latkes.”

Note: In the interest of helping omnivores in their shift toward flexitarianism / vegetarianism / veganism, several processed foods are included on the list above. While these can be very useful transitional “crutches,” it seems important to underscore that a subsequent move toward a whole-food diet is even better for optimal health.

“Having trained in so many great kitchens [in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including Gotham Bar & Grill and the River Café in New York City, as well as those of Guerard and Passard in France], I can still remember the days when the ‘veg plate’ was whatever you could pull together when someone asked for one, and definitely an afterthought. It is nice to see how it has evolved.”

VEGETARIAN FLAVOR MATCHMAKING: THE LISTS



“I am obsessed with the relationship between cooking and health. When one goes to the opera, one does not expect to return having gone deaf; one does not expect to go blind as a result of going to the theatre. Why then must one do oneself damage by going out to eat? For people who think this way, there is, on one hand, the cuisine for pleasure—but full of menace—and on the other, the diet—for the redemption of the body. This separation is odious, and we must find the means of reconciling pleasure and health. I dream of a cuisine that no longer does anyone harm.”

—ALAIN SENDERENS, PARIS-BASED MICHELIN THREE-STAR CHEF, AS QUOTED IN MIRIAM KASIN HOSPODAR’S 2001 BOOK HEAVEN’S BANQUET




“Chefs hold the key to health in the twenty-first century. And they will be the ones to change the perception that a plant-based diet has anything to do with lack—because, in truth, it opens up a world of abundance. There’s no need to sacrifice any of the mouthfeel, the richness, or the satisfaction that comes from eating the most delicious food.”

—CHEF CHAD SARNO, CO-AUTHOR WITH KRIS CARR OF THE BESTSELLING BOOK CRAZY SEXY KITCHEN



Chef Chad Sarno healed himself of his childhood asthma within six months of giving up dairy products, and he went on to embrace a plant-based diet. Having co-authored the bestselling cookbook Crazy Sexy Kitchen: 150 Plant-Empowered Recipes to Ignite a Mouthwatering Revolution with Kris Carr and served as lead culinary educator of Whole Foods Market’s healthy eating program, he now leads the Plant-Based Professional Certification Course at Rouxbe.com, which includes the unit “Flavor, Seasoning, and Texture.”

“As an educator and chef, the greatest hurdle that I have witnessed when budding chefs and students dive into the kitchen is the awakening and development of the instinct for flavor balancing, combining, and building,” says Sarno. “I have been telling people for years that The Flavor Bible is one of the greatest resources on the market to help guide this intuitive nature that comes with experience, and it is my own go-to book to get the ideas flowing. I think it should be a cornerstone resource for the modern chef and for every home and professional kitchen.”

Sarno has introduced the book and its flavor-pairing approach to participants in bestselling author Dr. John McDougall’s renowned weekend program when teaching seminars on the use of herbs and spices. “The starting point is typically thinking about seasonal products,” says Sarno. “I then skim the book to refresh my memory about classic combinations or to discover unique combinations I almost didn’t believe would work until I tried them for myself and found them awesome.”

The starting point for your creativity in the kitchen can be anything. As Sarno suggests, it often begins with the seasonal availability of a particular ingredient—such as spring’s first morel mushrooms or the arrival of pomegranates in autumn—or even the desire to cook in a particular way, such as firing up the grill in summer or warming the house with an oven-braised dish in winter. It can begin with a craving for the flavors of a particular country or region: the garlic and herbs of Provence, or the chiles and coconut milk of southeast Asia. Or it can begin with simple curiosity, such as the urge to experiment with a new ingredient or technique.

Recognizing this, I’ve provided a broad range of starting points in the A-to-Z (açai to zucchini blossoms) lists that follow: the seasons (with listings for autumn, spring, summer, and winter); an extensive variety of vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, mushrooms, sea vegetables, and other ingredients; dozens of world cuisines; and a broad array of flavorings and seasonings (from asafoetida to elderflower to toasted pumpkin seed oil), including dozens of different salts, peppers, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars.

Below each entry, you’ll find a distillation of an ingredient’s essence and summary of its key aspects: its season, flavor, volume, nutritional profile, and more. You’ll also find its most highly recommended cooking techniques and some useful tips to keep in mind when working with it. After all, some ingredients lend themselves to being prepared in a particular manner: While potatoes are versatile enough to be cooked in a number of ways (from baked to fried to mashed), delicate salad greens beg to be served raw, and root vegetables to be roasted or stewed.

When perusing the listings of compatible flavors, readers of The Flavor Bible and What to Drink with What You Eat will recognize the same ranking system used in those books to let you know which pairings are truly stellar. Those ingredients that appear in BOLD CAPS with an asterisk (*) are out-of-this-world, time-honored classics: these “marriages made in heaven” make up the top 1 or 2 percent of pairings. Next you’ll find very highly recommended pairings in BOLD CAPS. Bold, lowercase listings are frequently recommended pairings; and plain-text pairings are recommended pairings. And even when just a single top expert recommends a flavor combination, it’s very high praise indeed.


“If you like a mixture such as broccoli rabe, toasted almonds, and manchego cheese with pasta, chances are it’ll be great on pizza, too.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, CHEF OF SAN FRANCISCO’S GREENS RESTAURANT AND AUTHOR OF EVERYDAY GREENS



For many listings, you’ll also find groups of three or more “Flavor Affinities” (as they are called in The Flavor Bible; they are called “flavor cliques” in Culinary Artistry). These affinities will get you started on complex flavor combinations. In other cases, you’ll find some of America’s most creative chefs’ signature vegetarian dishes, so you can gain inspiration from some of the most celebrated vegetable-loving restaurant kitchens across the country.

Annie Somerville’s quotation gets to the heart of the usefulness of these listings: Once you understand flavors that work well together, you can use them in countless different applications, from pasta or pizza toppings to mix-ins for quiches or salads, or as the basis of soups or stews.

As the starting point for creating a dish can be anything at all, you’ll find a range of categories offering inspiration for any interest, such as specific ingredients (from açai to zucchini blossoms), particular cuisines (with alphabetical listings such as Ethiopian cuisine, French cuisine, Indian cuisine, etc.), the seasons (with alphabetical listings for autumn, spring, summer and winter), and more.

Throughout these pages, you’ll also find sidebars on subjects ranging from harnessing the “meatiness” of mushrooms to making pasta sauces from vegetable purees other than tomato. They’ll help you learn not only the “whats” of combining flavors, but also the “whys” and “hows.”

Keep an eye out for the distinctions being made among ingredients. After all, not even all salty condiments (e.g., salt itself, not to mention Bragg Liquid Aminos, soy sauce, tamari, etc.) are created equal. As you hone your selections, you’ll hone the quality of the flavors you’re able to create.


For years, I have traveled throughout North America, spending thousands of hours interviewing creative chefs and other experts on their most highly recommended flavor combinations. I’ve scoured their memories—along with their restaurant menus, websites, cookbooks, and other favorite books—for insights into building flavors. Their wisdom has been synthesized into the comprehensive, easy-to-use listings that follow. These listings represent a treasure trove of ideas for you to put to work in your own kitchen.

Armed with the extensive information that follows, you’ll learn how to better show off virtually any ingredient or to re-create the flavors of any world cuisine you can think of. From here on out, you’ll have the expert advice of some of America’s most imaginative vegetable-loving chefs at your disposal when you want to spark your own creativity. Whether you’re exploring a new flavor or looking for additional ideas for working with an ingredient you’ve cooked a thousand times, you’ll find helpful tips and a plethora of options here.

Flavor: virtually none

What it is: a thickening agent made from seaweed; a vegetarian substitute for gelatin



Nutritional profile: 94% carbs / 5% protein / 1% fat



Calories: 0 per 1-tablespoon serving



Tips: To gel, use about 2–3 teaspoons of agar powder (or 2–3 tablespoons of agar flakes) per 1 cup of boiling liquid. Unlike regular gelatin (which requires refrigeration), agar can gel at room temperature in about an hour (although it will gel twice as fast in the refrigerator). Substitute agar powder for the same amount of gelatin in recipes. Avoid raw mangoes, papayas, pineapple (whose enzymes won’t let agar set); cook these fruits first if you’d like to gel them.

AGAVE NECTAR


[ah-GAH-vay NECK-ter]



Flavor: sweet, with notes of caramel, fruit, honey, and/or maple syrup



Volume: quiet (light)–moderate (amber or dark)



What it is: sweetener similar in color and texture to honey, made from the agave plant, a Mexican succulent



Nutritional profile: 100% carbs



Calories: 20 per teaspoon



Tips: Agave is sweeter than sugar, so you can use less. Because baked goods made with agave may brown more quickly, lower oven temperature by 25°F and slightly extend baking time.

“It’s easier to make caramel sauce from agave nectar than it is to make it from sugar—because it’s already a liquid! Heat it on low, slow heat until it caramelizes, then stir in a little Earth Balance and almond or soy milk.”

ARROWROOT (aka ARROWROOT FLOUR, POWDER, or STARCH)


Flavor: virtually none



Volume: very quiet



What it is: a thickening agent, less processed than cornstarch, made from the arrowroot plant (a tuber grown in the tropics)



Gluten-free: yes



Tips: Dissolve in a little cold water before adding to sauces; or dissolve about one tablespoon of powder per cup of cold liquid before bringing it to a simmer. It becomes clear as it cooks. Stir constantly, and do not overheat, which makes arrowroot lose its thickening power.

“I love to grill asparagus simply and dress it with a Meyer lemon vinaigrette and serve it with some nice beets, goat cheese, and greens. We also make an asparagus pizza that people love. The asparagus is seasoned with olive oil, lemon zest, salt, and pepper and we let it sit to drain off some of its liquid so it won’t make the dough too soggy. Then we add some raw spring onions and raw green garlic, a little Fontina, feta, or Asiago cheese, and chili flakes, and put it on the dough. People are happy. I love to make asparagus with spring peas and fava beans in pasta or in a farro risotto.”

AVOCADO


Season: spring–summer



Flavor: buttery in flavor and texture, with fruity and nutty notes



Volume: quiet



What it is: technically a fruit



Nutritional profile: 77% fat / 19% carbs / 4% protein



Calories: 325 per avocado (raw)



Protein: 4 grams



Techniques: Always serve raw, as cooking makes avocados taste bitter. Mash into guacamole, hummus, or sandwich spreads, or slice for salads.



Tips: Haas avocados are the smaller, dark green, firm variety (more flavorful, and better for guacamole), while Florida avocados are larger and brighter green (and they can sometimes be watery). Use avocados to add richness to a dish, whether a dip or spread or even a dessert.

“Avocados are key vegetables for raw foodists. They’re meaty and creamy at the same time, and versatile enough to be used in salad dressings, soups, and wraps.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“I love avocados and eat one every day. In one of my favorite salads, the richness of avocado is balanced by the acidity of tomato and the sweetness of watermelon. And avocados are versatile; as a pastry chef, I even use them in my chocolate mousse.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Mashed avocado on bread is like the PB&J of Jamaica. After my friends and I played soccer, we’d raid the cupboard for bread and climb the tree in my backyard for ‘pears,’ as we call them there, to eat on the bread, maybe with just a little salt. Their flavor is so fresh and bright.”

What it is: fruit



Nutritional profile: 93% carbs / 4% protein / 3% fat



Calories: 105 per medium banana (raw)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake, broil, caramelize, deep-fry, freeze (e.g., for smoothies), grill, poach, puree, raw, sauté



Tips: Freeze before adding to smoothies to eliminate or reduce the need for ice. Puree frozen bananas—or put through a Champion juicer (using the “Blank” instead of the “Screen”), and they will come out the texture of soft-serve ice cream to enjoy as-is or with toppings such as maple syrup and nuts.

BARLEY (e.g., HULLED)


Flavor: sweet, with astringent notes of nuts, and chewy in texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: whole grain



Nutritional profile: 82% carbs / 13% protein / 5% fat



Gluten-free: no



Calories: 100 per 1-ounce serving (yields about ½ cup)



Protein: 3 grams



Techniques: boil, pressure-cook, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Soak overnight before cooking. Cook presoaked whole barley about 35–40 minutes or longer, covered. If not presoaked, cook about 75 minutes, until tender. (Note: Quick-cooking barley takes only 10–15 minutes.)



Ratio: 1:3 (1 part barley to 3 parts cooking liquid)



Tips: For a deeper flavor, toast barley before soaking and cooking. For maximum nutrition, opt for hulled barley (which has an extra layer of fiber-rich bran), versus pearl barley (which has its outer husk removed). Try barley flakes instead of rolled oats in breakfast cereals.

Volume: quiet (powder)–moderate/loud (syrup)



What it is: sweetener



Tips: Barley malt powder can be substituted for sugar. Barley malt syrup can be substituted for brown rice syrup, honey, or molasses. Select organic 100-percent barley malt syrup.

“Barley malt syrup is a great liquid sweetener I’ll use to sweeten desserts like custards, or when making candied nuts. Its flavor is distinctive—it’s already caramelized, almost like a great Madeira or sherry. I use it in a dessert based on beer and pretzels, where it plays against the maltiness of the beer.”

BARLEY, PEARL (or PEARLED)


Flavor: slightly sweet, with notes of nuts, and a soft, chewy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: grain (not whole)



Nutritional profile: 90% carbs / 7% protein / 3% fat



Calories: 195 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 4 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer



Timing: Cook about 30–75 minutes, until tender.



Ratio: 1: 2 ½–3 ½ (1 cup barley to 2 ½–3 ½ cups cooking liquid)



Tip: Opt for whole-grain barley (which is higher in fiber; see BARLEY) when you have the extra time to cook it; otherwise, faster-cooking pearl barley (which doesn’t require presoaking) will do.

BEANS—IN GENERAL (or MIXED)


What they are: legumes



Techniques: Always cook thoroughly.



Timing: Most beans require anywhere from a half-hour to two hours to cook, depending on the type of bean and length of presoaking.



Tips: Soak dried beans overnight (or for 8–10 hours) before cooking. Drain and rinse the beans before cooking in fresh water for about 1–3 hours, depending on the type of bean. While you can add alliums (e.g., garlic, onions) or herbs (e.g., parsley, thyme) during the cooking process, do not add acid (e.g., lemon, tomato, vinegar) during cooking; acids may interfere with the cooking process. If you don’t buy salt-free canned beans, rinse before using. Dried beans will typically yield three times their quantity in cooked beans (i.e., ⅓ cup dried beans = 1 cup cooked beans). Certain compatible seasonings also aid in the digestion of beans, e.g., asafoetida, cumin, fennel, ginger, kombu, savory.

“We only cook our beans in clay pots, called olla de barro, because they taste so much better cooked that way. When we first experimented, we soaked the beans overnight, then cooked half in a traditional metal pot and the other half in a clay pot [which transmits heat more gently, allowing flavors to develop more slowly but with greater depth]. You could absolutely taste the difference.”

“Our beet tartare is a play on beef tartare, so I thought about my associations with both tartare and with beets. The tartare inspired the capers, shallots, and [vegan] Worcestershire sauce, while the beets inspired the dill and orange. Quail eggs are a lighter, more delicate take on traditional egg yolks.”

“Many people say they don’t like the flavor of bell peppers, but I think they actually don’t like raw bell peppers. Their season in California is short [September–October], but red and yellow peppers are wonderful grilled, roasted, or sautéed in curries and soups—and yes, even raw when served with hummus. They’re easy to peel if you oven-roast them, then put them in a covered bowl to steam—the peel will come right off.”

BITTERNESS


Taste: bitter



Function: cooling; stimulates appetite; promotes other tastes



Tips: Bitterness relieves thirst. When a bitter component is added to a dish, it creates a sense of lightness. The hotter the food or drink, the lesser the perception of bitterness.

arugula

baking powder and baking soda

beans, lima

beer, esp. hoppy (e.g., bitter ales)

“The way Jean-Georges Vongerichten thinks about flavors is exceptional. I made his recipe for Brussels sprouts [with toasted pecans and avocado] that appeared in Food and Wine, and it was amazingly good.”

—SELMA MIRIAM, BLOODROOT (BRIDGEPORT, CT)




“In mainstream restaurants, you’ll inevitably see Brussels sprouts served with bacon. We serve them with smoked tofu, whose smokiness serves as the ‘bacon,’ accented by the sweetness of orange juice and a hint of agave plus the umami of miso.”

“Cacao, which is essentially unprocessed chocolate, is one of nature’s most powerful superfoods. In addition to its nutritional benefits, it is a stimulant without negative side effects. I use cacao nibs or powder or pods for our chocolate frostings and truffles. I’ll substitute raw carob powder if I want a similar flavor with no stimulants.”

“Theo Schoenegger [of Sinatra Restaurant in Las Vegas] is awesome and is one of the best Italian chefs working in America. He is also one of the most open-minded people I have worked with. He likes to eat healthy and acknowledges that Americans eat far too much meat and animal protein three times a day / seven days a week, so he was digging the vegan stuff I was showing him. Together, we created a vegan agnolotti and a vegan Caesar salad. For Caesar salad, to add the briny flavor you need, I use capers instead of anchovies—and people love it.”

“Use the whole carrot. Put the greens in salad, or cook them with some risotto—they are very good for you.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Carrots and cumin are great together.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“We juice carrots to use for stocks or other dishes, and then dehydrate the pulp. We confit carrots in oil, herbs, and spices to get that nice, fatty, succulent confit texture out of a carrot. We will fry some carrots into chips and pulse them into crumbs. We might pickle some carrots or ferment them, then dehydrate them and grind them into a powder to use as a seasoning. So we have now taken a carrot eight ways and give you those components back on one dish or throughout the four courses that you have during the course of a meal here. You have now gotten this whole depth of flavor from this carrot. If we do that with anywhere from two to eight components on a menu, all of a sudden you and your palate have been elevated to a whole different level. I equate it to an Old World wine compared to a New World wine: it is still red wine, but it is completely different.”

“The texture of cashews is so incredibly creamy, and works well in everything from appetizers to cashew cheese to entrees to desserts, which I’ll even top with a whipped cashew cream. Most live raw cheesecakes—which can range from German chocolate to key lime in flavor—are cashew-based, and they’re delicious.”

CAULIFLOWER


Season: autumn–winter



Flavor: sweet, with pungent notes of butter, mustard, nuts, and/or pepper, and a soft yet crunchy (when raw) / creamy (when cooked) texture



Volume: moderate



Nutritional profile: 64% carbs / 20% protein / 16% fat



Calories: 15 per ½-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: Better served cooked than raw. Bake, blanch, boil, braise, deep-fry, dry, fry, juice, mash, pressure-cook (2–3 minutes), puree, roast (20–25 minutes at 400°F), sauté, simmer, smoke, steam (5–10 minutes), stir-fry (2–5 minutes); however, overcooking highlights sulphur notes.



Tips: Do not overcook. Add pureed cauliflower to vegetable soups to give a creamy texture. Or slice thickly (¾ inch) into “steaks” and sauté to brown.

“I learned through testing that I don’t like maple-smoked cauliflower—I prefer it hickory-smoked. I’ll smoke, bread, and deep-fry cauliflower, which looks like chicken, and serve it with waffles for a play on chicken-and-waffles.”

“I love chard! I love cooking the stems of rainbow chard, which have so much flavor. Just slice them and toss them in hot olive oil for one or two minutes, then add the greens, some garlic, some water or stock, and salt and pepper, and let them cook another two or three minutes. You can finish them with almonds, pine nuts, or pumpkin seeds for a little texture—and a shake of chili pepper flakes if you want a little kick.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)



“What we do here is build flavors: For example, we will stew chard with onions, garlic, and other traditional stewing ingredients that are really tasty, and then dehydrate some of it and turn it into a powder that will get worked into a gnocchi or pasta dough. It is a seasoning component that you would use about 5 percent in the dough. Next, you take the chard you didn’t dehydrate and put that in the dish with the gnocchi on top. We will also fry some chard as a garnish. All of the sudden, the chard takes on a whole level of flavor because we have incorporated it into different forms within the dish. So when people eat it, they say, ‘Wow—I have never tasted chard like this!’ This happens because we did not simply sauté some chard; we manipulated it, thought it through, and gave it back to you on a dish in a whole multitude of ways.”

“I love burrata cheese. We have served it warm with pasta and pesto, or with pickled vegetables and crispy quinoa, or with carrot top pesto along with carrots and fava beans, and even with cantaloupe with melon granite and toasted cashews. I want to take a cheese that people are familiar with and show that you can use it during all four seasons. There is a cheese maker here in the U.S. from Puglia who makes incredible cheese [sold by Zingerman’s].”

Say (Vegan) Cheese!


Many vegans enjoy Daiya or Follow Your Heart brand vegan cheeses, which come in various flavors (e.g., cheddar, mozzarella) and often melt and stretch much as dairy cheese does.

I have been more impressed with the flavor of the artisanal vegan cheeses I’ve tasted, such as those at Pure Food and Wine in Manhattan. Portobello in Portland, Oregon, serves an artisanal vegan cheese plate that showcases cheeses from cheese-makers across the country, including Field Roast, Seattle-based producer of Chao Cheese (herb-crusted, tofu-based cheeses), Door 86 (Nashville), Heidi Ho (Portland, OR), Kite Hill (Hayward, CA), Punk Rawk Labs (Minneapolis), and Treeline Treenut Cheese (Kingston, NY).

Interested in making your own? Check out Miyoko Schinner’s 2012 book Artisan Vegan Cheese, which is developing a cult following among vegan chefs and foodies.

“When cherries come in, I love to use them in savory dishes. I like to pair them with a creamy burrata, which is a nice textural contrast. I might use them in a gastrique to create a sweet and sour flavor to play off the creaminess of the cheese. Cherries are also great with grains like farro or freekeh with lots of lemon. I like cherries with sweeter herbs like chervil or parsley, and they are great with basil. Cherries pair well with nuts, but since they’re used with almonds so much, I will pair them with black walnuts.”

“I didn’t grow up with chiles [in Michigan], but they’ve grown on me over the years. Poblano chiles are my favorite. I love their great aroma and smoky flavor, and will fire roast them on an Asador grill [aka a chile pepper grill or dry roaster] on the stovetop. I’ll stuff them with quinoa and goat cheese, and serve with ancho and chipotle chiles, corn, cilantro, marjoram, and a little lime to perk it all up!”

“I spent two years in Hong Kong and found what they were doing with vegetarian food was very inspiring. At the time there was nowhere [in North America] to eat vegetarian food unless you wanted ‘hippy and crunchy.’ But in Hong Kong, it was natural because people ate vegetarian once or more a week and it was not considered weird. The flavors they were able to coax from meatless ingredients were amazing.”

“I love fresh young coconut meat, even plain. But if you add avocado and lime, you can make a pudding to die for! And you can also take it savory by making a ‘beef jerky’ from dehydrated coconut blended with cayenne, liquid smoke, and raw agave or maple syrup—it’s incredible.”

“I’ll whip very cold coconut cream with a little agave nectar and vanilla in the KitchenAid with the whisk attachment for about 5–10 minutes to make a really luscious topping. The colder the coconut cream, the less time it takes to whip.”

“Corn is a religion where I grew up [in the New York Finger Lakes region]. We treat corn like the French treat their baguettes. You don’t eat the baguettes you bought in the morning for dinner! Likewise, you buy and serve corn as fresh as possible. Corn is all about timing because it loses fifty percent of its sweetness after harvest. Farmers pick corn three times a day: at seven in the morning, at noon, and at three. Seven a.m. is the best, but you have to eat it for lunch. You buy your three o’clock corn for dinner. I like it simple: corn, butter, and salt. My wife Isabel [Bogadtke] likes her corn with lime and cumin seeds.”

—CHRISTOPHER BATES, HOTEL FAUCHERE (MILFORD, PA)




“Corn is the one ingredient I work with best, and I get a non-GMO corn so it tastes great. I will focus in on it, and it will end up being the favorite of both our guests and our servers. I made a chilled corn soup that people loved: I cut the corn off the cob, made corn milk, made a stock out of corn cobs, sautéed the corn in a bunch of onion, thyme, and garlic, then added the corn milk and stock. I reduced it, pureed it all together, and added some half and half. I served the soup with shaved radishes and parsley. It’s great because it is a cold soup when it is hot out, with the peppery radishes cutting the richness of the soup and an accent of vegetal green parsley rounding out the flavor and bringing it all together.”

CORNMEAL and POLENTA (see also GRITS)


Flavor: sweet, with notes of butter and/or corn, and a creamy texture (when cooked)



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: grain, made of dried corn kernels, ground to fine (e.g., corn flour, cornstarch), medium, or coarse (e.g., grits, polenta) texture



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 8% fat / 6% protein



Calories: 220 per ½-cup serving (whole grain, yellow, uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, broil, fry, grill, sauté, simmer



Timing: Cook until tender according to instructions on the back of the package, as this can vary from 1 minute (instant or fine) to 20–45 minutes (coarse).



Ratio: 1:3 (firm cornmeal, e.g., to grill or sauté) to 1:5–6 (soft, creamy cornmeal or polenta)



Tips: Opt for organic cornmeal. Use blue cornmeal, which is higher in protein than regular cornmeal, when you wish to add a light blueish, purplish hue to foods. Serve creamy polenta as an alternative to mashed potatoes. Alternatively, let polenta cool in a sheet pan; then cut into slices and broil, grill, or sauté lightly, before serving with tomato sauce and/or marinated vegetables.



Brand: Finely ground de la Estancia Organic Polenta is not an instant product but cooks to tender in less than 1 minute!

CREAM, HEAVY


Nutritional profile: 94% fat / 3% carbs / 3% protein



Tips: Use silken tofu instead of actual cream to create creamy vegan sauces. Or heed the insight of the Cooking Lab’s director of applied research, Scott Heimendinger: “Dairy cream is an emulsion of fat and water. Once you realize that, with the right approach you can make ‘cream’ out of anything.”





“CREAM,” CASHEW


Flavor: neutral, with notes of nuts, and a rich, creamy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: raw cashew nuts that have been soaked overnight in water and finely pureed with water to achieve the consistency of cream



Tip: Substitute cashew cream for regular cream.

“I like making hot cucumber soup at home: I’ll cook the cucumbers with onion and a little extra-virgin olive oil and then add cumin, coriander, and masala curry. If I want the soup bright green, I’ll not add any white wine, but if I want a dull green, I’ll add white wine. To finish the soup, I might add either yogurt or crème fraîche—or if I want to take it even farther, I’ll add some kefir.”

“Cumin is one of my favorite spices, and a great supporting flavor. Its earthy/nutty/smoky flavor is very strong and can easily kill a dish—so you never want to use enough so that it can be tasted. Instead, just sprinkle a little on so that people will ask, ‘What is that flavor?!’ ”

—RICH LANDAU, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)




“I love the smell of cumin, which reminds me of walking through the woods in Jamaica.… It’s very good with grains, as it brings out their earthy, woody flavor.”

DEHYDRATING



“We use our dehydrator for a variety of things, including our powders, which we use a lot of. For example, we will dehydrate celery and then turn it into a powder for celery cake. We also dehydrate yellow tomatoes for tomato powder. We’ll also use the dehydrator for creating leathers with tomatoes, beets, and pears, or for turning cauliflower into crunchy little bits. Anything you can do in a dehydrator, you can do in an oven—it is simply faster using the dehydrator. The reason I use one is that if you are dehydrating something in the oven, you can’t use your oven for anything else.”

“Our number-one dessert is crumbles. They’re seasonal, but often apple- or pear-based with berries. We’ll sweeten them with agave or brown sugar and season with some citrus zest and a splash of gin. Our topping is simple: brown sugar, a gluten-free flour blend (such as chickpea, rice, tapioca, and sorghum flours), and margarine or palm shortening.”

“We use five or six different varieties of eggplant—including Japanese eggplant, which have thinner skin and more meat to them. We have eggplant from May to November, which is seven months of eggplant. To keep it new, we choose different countries for inspiration. For example, I did a pop-up dinner and made Chinese sweet-and-sour eggplant, cooking it with chiles, Chinese vinegar, garlic, dark soy sauce, and cilantro. Sautéing the eggplant with all these ingredients makes it soak up all the flavors.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love vegetables in dessert because it is fun—that is number one! This is where we have our most creative dishes. The vegetable will be the catalyst, but I don’t want you leaving with a vegetable flavor—I want your last bite to be a sweet, happy moment at the end of the meal that brings together everything you just ate. Eggplant is more fruit than vegetable because it has seeds. It’s also like tofu in that it doesn’t have much flavor but will soak up the flavors you put it with. Eggplant has a luscious texture. I don’t know why I got obsessed with making eggplant tiramisu, but for some reason I did. We mix eggplant with mascarpone and then put it between layers of rosemary ladyfingers and it is just perfect!

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“You can’t not get the Eggplant Braciole when you come to Vedge. The dish is thin layers of eggplant that have been poached in olive oil and that are then wrapped around a filling of eggplant and roasted crushed cauliflower, finished with a green salsa verde. It has a lot of fresh herbs, a good punch of salt, and cured black olive on top. It has so many strong flavors, but you still taste eggplant and cauliflower. These dishes transcend the season, which we thought was important to do.”

—RICH LANDAU AND KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)





“I’m working on a new roasted and stuffed eggplant dish right now, and the secret is avoiding the monotony of texture. I’m sure the dish will have some pine nuts for crunch, and most likely also some bulgur for chewiness, accented by feta cheese, onions, and lemon zest.”

Vegan Egg Substitutes


For breakfast, instead of scrambling eggs, “scramble” tofu (e.g., extra-firm) with herbs and/or vegetables. Firm tofu also replaces hard-boiled egg whites in vegan dishes (e.g., “egg salads”).


When baking, you can use Ener-G Egg Replacer, a potato starch–based product that can often replace eggs in the ratio of 1½ teaspoons Ener-G to 2 tablespoons water for each egg, or other commercial egg replacers. However, there are probably already egg replacers in your cupboard or refrigerator, as you’ll see below.


How to know which other substitute to use? First, determine whether its need is for binding (i.e., holding the mixture together, without the need to rise, e.g., casseroles, veggie burgers), leavening (i.e., by adding air bubbles to a batter or dough, as well-beaten eggs do, e.g., in baked goods such as breads, cakes, cupcakes, or muffins), or simply adding moisture.





Egg Substitutes, each equivalent to 1 egg (best use)


¼ cup applesauce (adding moisture, e.g., in brownies, cakes, cupcakes, quickbreads)

¼ cup avocado, mashed (binding)

1 teaspoon baking soda + 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (leavening and adding moisture)

½ mashed banana (adding moisture and/or binding, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)

¼ cup carbonated water (leavening)

1 tablespoon chia seed meal + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (adding moisture; for leavening, add ¼ teaspoon baking powder)

¼ cup full-fat coconut milk + 1 teaspoon baking powder (leavening, esp. in compatibly flavored dishes)

¼ cup dried fruit (e.g., apricot, prune) puree (adding moisture)

1 tablespoon ground flax seeds + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (binding; for leavening: add ¼ teaspoon baking powder, esp. in nut/seed-compatible dishes, e.g., whole-grain cookies, muffins, pancakes)

3 tablespoons nut butter, e.g., peanut (binding, e.g., grain-based veggie burgers)

¼ cup silken tofu, blended (adding moisture, esp. in heavier baked goods, e.g., brownies, carrot cakes)

¼ cup vegetable puree, e.g., beets, carrots, pumpkin (adding moisture)

¼ cup yogurt, dairy or nondairy (adding moisture, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)



“We don’t cook with eggs, so I use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with baking powder to make my cakes rise. I’ve used Ener-G Egg Replacer when baking cookies. It has also worked surprisingly well in ‘meringues’ and looks beautiful.”

FARRO (aka EMMER WHEAT)


[FAHR-oh]



Flavor: slightly sweet, with earthy notes of barley and/or nuts, and a chewy texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: whole grain; Note: farro is not the same as spelt, which is typically a very slow-cooking grain.



Gluten-free: no



Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 12% protein / 7% fat



Calories: 170 per ¼ cup (uncooked)



Protein: 7 grams



Timing: Presoak farro for fastest cooking. Although whole farro is available, most of the farro available in the U.S. is semipearled (semi-perlato or pearled (perlato), i.e., with some or all of the outside husk removed. Whole farro takes longest to cook (45–60 minutes or longer), while pearled farro can cook in as little as half that time. Simmer farro, covered, until tender.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup farro to 2–3 cups cooking liquid)



Tip: Add the cooking water from white cannellini beans to give a creamier, starchier texture to “farrotto.”

“Farro is my favorite grain because of its nuttiness. I like mixing it into green salads with dried apricots and radishes.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love farro’s nutty flavor and toothy texture, and the sensation of eating farrotto. Farro doesn’t give off starch the same way Arborio rice does, but it still has some of its own sauce like risotto.… You can make a different version each season: Spring calls for lots of peas, spring onions, spinach, and vegetable stock. Summer could be corn with tomatoes. Autumn farroto with butternut squash, kale, and roasted garlic could have Parmesan shaved on top. Winter farrotto could feature wild mushrooms and either vegetable stock or the soaking water from dried porcini.”

FENUGREEK


Flavor: bitter/sweet; aromatic, with pungent and/or savory notes of burnt sugar, caramel, celery, chocolate, coffee, and/or maple syrup



Volume: quiet/moderate (leaves)–moderate/loud (seeds)



What it is: used as an herb (dried or fresh leaves), a spice (seeds), and as a vegetable (fresh)



Tips: Toast fenugreek seeds to bring out their flavor, which resembles maple syrup. (Indeed, fenugreek is used in making artificial maple syrup.) Long cooking (e.g., simmering) will quiet their flavor. Sprouted fenugreek seeds can be used in salads.

What they are: seeds



Who says they’re healthful: Joel Fuhrman, in his “Top Super Foods for Super Immunity”



What’s healthful about them: 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds every day—such as on cereal or in a smoothie—fulfills daily omega-3 fatty acids needs.



Tips: Buy whole seeds and grind immediately before using. Seeds must be ground to release their full nutritional value. Do not cook on high heat if you want to maintain nutritional benefits. To use as an egg substitute when baking, use 1 heaping tablespoon to substitute for 1 large egg: soak flaxseeds in hot water in a 1:3 ratio before blending into a thick paste (1 tablespoon flaxseeds to 3 tablespoons water).

FLOUR, RICE



“I like to use rice flour—grinding in some Arborio rice for texture, and some sesame or coriander seeds for texture and flavor—as a crust for fried mushrooms. Just dip the mushrooms into soy milk, or rice milk with a little Dijon mustard added for viscosity, and then into the rice flour mixture before frying.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)





FLOUR, SPELT



“Because spelt flour doesn’t have as much gluten as wheat flour, muffins made with it don’t rise as high, so instead of filling muffin tins two-thirds full, we fill them three-quarters full.”

—MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX, AZ)




“We make apple cider doughnuts with spelt flour, which is very good for you, with lots of vitamins and easy to digest. We tried making the doughnut with whole-grain wheat flour, but it was very heavy. To sweeten the doughnut as well as other cakes, I use maple syrup, which is not overpowering. In 2010, Time Out awarded us ‘best doughnut,’ and the funny thing is my partner owns a Dunkin’ Donuts.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)

Brands: Essential Eating, To Your Health





Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company


As a chef, my interest is in whole-plant cooking—from root to fruit—as integral to a more healthful and enjoyable way of living. But food has to first satisfy taste, so the challenge is always to find the right combination of ingredients and balance of flavors and textures. I have been experimenting with grains and beans in nontraditional ways: folded into muffins, added to savory custards, and pulverized into tart crusts. This also allows me to bring energy-rich plant foods into our products replacing white flours and sugars, which are devoid of nutrition. Sprouted-grain flours are especially interesting to me because they offer not only great flavor, but also an energy-rich ingredient for baked goods.

Because my kitchen is focused on developing savory baked items, I try to create the flavors first and then select how they are best presented.

Here are some combos:





Savory:


sprouted spelt flour muffin with asparagus, sorrel, pumpkin seed, and parmesan

sprouted corn flour muffin with pickled beet, macadamia nut, and goat cheese

millet flour biscuit with roasted chickpeas, sumac, and sesame seed

savory rice pudding with confit of fennel, carrot, and tarragon

quinoa pudding with broccoli and cheddar





Fruit:


coconut flour scone with wild blueberries, ginger root, and hempseed

wild rice and quinoa muffin with bananas, dried cranberries, and walnuts

chocolate cherry scone with vanilla bean kefir and almonds

strawberry jam muffin with pomegranate molasses, Meyer lemon, and chia seed





FLOWERS, EDIBLE


While several varieties of flowers are edible—such as (sweet licorice) anise hyssop, (cucumber-like, sweet honey-like) borage, carnations, chicory, (garlicy, oniony) chives, chrysanthemums, daisies, day lilies, (herbal, pungent, sweet) lavender, (bitter, floral, sour) marigolds, (honey, peppery) nasturtiums, (minty) pansies, and (sweet) violets—most do not add much flavor of their own. Rather, they’re mostly decorative.





“We grow edible flowers on our roof at Mélisse.… Pollen is what gives most edible flowers their sweet, individual flavors.… Nasturtiums are stronger flavored than most edible flowers—they have a very strong, floral, peppery, spicy flavor. Yellow wood sorrel is also strongly sour.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)





FREEKEH (aka FRIKEH)


[FREE-kah]



Flavor: earthy notes of grass, meat, nuts, and/or smoke, with a chewy texture



Volume: moderate



What it is: young green wheat that has been set on fire before harvesting; i.e., grain



Techniques: simmer (20–30 minutes)



Ratio: 1: 1½–2 (1 cup freekeh to 1½–2 cups cooking liquid)



Tip: To bring out its nuttiness, toast in a pan before cooking.



Possible substitute: bulgur + drops of liquid smoke

“When I was twenty-six, I went to France for the first time. My takeaway was that the French love vegetables! It was simple food with a tremendous impact. I also learned that they love to use pressure cookers to cook their vegetables. It makes the vegetables turn into a soft state, sort of a melting texture. The aromas from this technique are like nothing else.… During my time in France, it felt like every meal had a tart! Or if Americans are thought to always be eating hot dogs and hamburgers, I felt the same could be said about the French and their tarts. In France, lunch is the big meal of the day, so dinner is often lighter—such as a zucchini tart with custard and curry spices, served with a salad. I learned from a French woman to make my tart dough with half-butter, half-margarine, which made a crisper tart shell, but now I use 100 percent Earth Balance for our vegan tart.”

“Ginger might not have been a part of traditional Shojin [Buddhist monk] cuisine, but I can’t imagine not using it—I can’t be restrained by the old rules, which also prohibited tea and alcohol. Ginger is a magical ingredient with extraordinary flavor and textures that goes well with almost everything, and it has healing properties that can quickly and inexpensively heal my wife’s winter colds.… One of my secrets when making pickled ginger is instead of cooling the ginger in the boiling pickling liquid in the fridge, I’ll drain it and cool it with a fan, which concentrates its flavor.”

Tips: It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of grains you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, there are some general rules of thumb that may be helpful: Rinse grains before cooking. Combine grain with the cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid in the ratio indicated for the specific grain. Bring to a boil, add the grain, and bring to a boil again. Then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for the cooking time indicated. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved; then remove from heat and leave covered for 5–15 minutes before fluffing with a fork and serving.

“You can’t overcook grains like barley or farro. Cooking farro risotto style as farrotto is common in Italy, and I’ll cook barley the same way, so that it’s chewy and toothy. But bulgur can overcook and turn mushy, so you really have to keep an eye on it. Grains are also great to dehydrate and powder for crusts… or to dry [dehydrate] and fry, to turn into ‘Rice Krispies.’ ”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“The secret is not to serve too large a portion of grains on a plate or people will get bored with them. I like to season grains with dried fruits, such as apricots, currants, figs, or apples and pears in the winter. Or I’ll season them with powders and ashes [made from dehydrated vegetables]. Or I’ll fill things like cabbage, chard, or kale with grains, and roll them up dolma-style—such as quinoa and dehydrated kimchi powder wrapped up in a cabbage leaf with dried figs or currants and pickled peppers or cucumbers. The overall impact it makes takes your brain on a ride.”

“There are two ends of the cooking spectrum you want to concentrate on—one is high heat and the other is low heat. On high heat you want to cook your vegetable higher and faster than you normally would to get that sear and caramelization and let it stay crunchy on the inside so you have a textural contrast. Or go low and slow; that way you get a crispy outside and a dehydrated chew on the inside. Home cooks know how to do this with meat; they just need to do it with vegetables. A good example of a high-heat, fast-cooking dish we do now is the Chinese green choy sum. It gets a nice crispiness, it is barely cooked, and it gets tossed in a bowl and wilts on itself. If we cook the choy sum really low, it turns into a flat, dehydrated, crispy green.”

“After cutting the spiny part out of the collard greens, soak them in lemon juice to soften them, and wrap them around ingredients for a breadless ‘sandwich,’ or use them instead of nori to make vegetarian maki rolls. Use a mandoline to slice vegetables to tuck inside.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)




“When collard greens are cooked right, they have a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I like to cook them with a little olive oil, sliced garlic, a splash of water, and a pinch of salt, and to serve them as a side dish to Creole-style tempeh with mashed potatoes.”

“I grill almost every vegetable—radishes, kohlrabi, cabbage. Even spinach, kale, and chard—I’ll put some olive oil and salt on them, pile them up, and grill them on high heat, flipping them twice. Grilled beets are great, although I’ll parcook them for about five minutes first, so they’re a little soft—and you can cook parsnips and radishes the same way.”

HIZIKI (aka HIJIKI)


[hee-ZEE-kee; hee-JEE-kee]



Flavor: salty, with notes of the earth and/or sea, and a delicate yet firm texture



Volume: moderate–loud



What it is: sea vegetable, with the appearance of dried black threads



Calories: 5 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: sauté, simmer (about 30–40 minutes)



Tips: Its grittiness requires it to be soaked (twice) in cold water for 10 minutes each time before use (discarding the gritty soaking water). Soaking will also tame its saltiness. Also, hiziki will expand fourfold, taking on the appearance of black angel hair pasta.

JACKFRUIT, UNRIPE GREEN


Season: summer



Flavor: neutral, with faint notes of apple, banana, lychee, mango, melon (e.g., cantaloupe), and/or pineapple; and the chewy, flaky, juicy, or meaty texture of dry pineapple, shredded chicken, or pulled pork



Volume: quiet



What it is: tropical fruit



Nutritional profile: 92% carbs / 5% protein / 3% fat



Calories: 155 per 1-cup serving (sliced, raw)



Protein: 2 grams



Technique: marinate



Tips: Look in Asian or Indian markets for unripe (aka green or young) jackfruit in cans (packed in brine, not sweet syrup!) or frozen (packed in brine). Chef Susan Feniger prefers using shredded and cooked jackfruit to processed faux meats in Street’s vegan dishes such as baos and tacos. She has found that jackfruit takes on whatever flavors it’s cooked with and even fools meat eaters. You’ll typically want to rinse, drain, and shred before using; alternatively, cut into bite-sized triangles, as you would pineapple. Jackfruit is the world’s largest tree fruit and can grow up to three feet long. Keep an eye out for products from Annie Ryu’s Global Village Fruits.

JUICES (see also SMOOTHIES)


Technique Tips: We love our Champion juicer (as do many of the other experts interviewed for this book) and know others who are happy with their Omega juicers. Diane Forley of Flourish makes juice in her Vitamix, adding a little water and then straining the juice through a nut milk bag—and finds the cleanup even easier than with a juicer.

Flavor Tips: Avoid mixing kale with romaine, which ends up “tasting like mud,” according to NYC’s Blossom owner Pamela Elizabeth. To add a sweet note, mix green juices with agave nectar, beets, coconut water, dates, fruit, honey, or maple syrup.





“My favorite green juice is made from apples, celery, collard greens, kale, and lemon.”

—DIANE FORLEY, FLOURISH (SCARSDALE, NEW YORK)




“My default morning juice is one made from cilantro, fennel, ginger, kale, lemon, pears, and pineapple.”

—MATTHEW KENNEY, M.A.K.E. (SANTA MONICA)




“A dash of lemon juice is the best way to cut the ‘fresh-mown grass’ flavor of some of the stronger green juices. Even better is adding lemon juice, apple juice, and ginger.”

KALE


Season: autumn–spring



Flavor: bitter/sweet (esp. in winter), with pungent notes of cabbage, and a rather tough texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: leafy, green vegetable



Nutritional profile: 72% carbs / 16% protein / 12% fat



Calories: 35 per 1-cup serving (raw, chopped)



Protein: 2 grams



Techniques: blanch, boil (4–5 minutes), braise, grill, long cooking, marinate, parboil, puree, raw, sauté (about 8 minutes over medium heat), steam (4–5 minutes), stew, stir-fry



Tips: Opt for organic kale. Many kale aficionados prefer the variety known as black kale (aka dinosaur kale or Tuscan kale), for its greater flavor complexity and silky texture. Macerate (and marinate) raw kale in Dijon mustard to flavor it and soften its texture.

“Kale isn’t a summer crop, but there’s so much demand for it that it’s served year-round. In the summer, the hot sun can make it more bitter and tougher, so it’s less of a salad green and more of a braising green, requiring longer cooking to soften it.”

—PAM BROWN, GARDEN CAFÉ (WOODSTOCK, NY)




“If I’m making a kale salad, I’ll massage the kale with oil and maybe Dijon mustard. I want a combination of acid, oil, and salt.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“I love serving charred kale with smoked tofu, which I’ll mince like bacon bits and let provide the same kind of smoky accent.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I love kale—and was an early adapter. I’ve only eaten it raw over the past couple of years. Before that, I preferred it braised, or sautéed with garlic and olive oil, or added to pasta along with feta cheese and pine nuts.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR OF THE MOOSEWOOD COOKBOOK AND THE HEART OF THE PLATE




“We go through crates and crates of kale every week, and always prefer the less bitter, more refined blue-green Tuscan kale over regular kale, which is much tougher. With either kale, we’ll marinate it in garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to soften it.”

—CASSIE AND MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)

“I love kasha in salads, where its earthy flavor is balanced nicely by the sweetness of corn. Not only is it great in stuffed cabbage and pilafs, but I like it as croquettes: I’ll make them from kasha and mashed potatoes, browning them in a skillet, and serving them with a sauce or just some caramelized onions.”

“I had no clue how to create a vegan seafood dish. Creating vegan clam chowder was a by-product of having extra kombu broth around. We ended up adding some potatoes, smoked oyster mushrooms, and cashew cream to replace traditional cream, and it worked out great.”

LEGUMES (see also specific BEANS, CHICKPEAS, LENTILS, PEANUTS, PEAS, and SOYBEANS)


Tip: Many chefs are experimenting with smoking legumes to enhance their “meatiness.”





Cooking Legumes


There are three major categories of legumes:

pulses, including chickpeas, lentils, dried beans, dried peas

fresh beans and fresh peas

peanuts and soybeans



It’s best to follow the specific directions on the package of legumes you are using and to understand that timing can still vary depending on a number of factors, including heat level and heat conductivity of the pot you use. However, here are some helpful rules of thumb:

Rinse legumes to remove any dirt or foreign objects (e.g., tiny pebbles).

Soak most legumes overnight in water before cooking. This shortens their cooking time and increases their digestibility. Discard the soaking water. (If time is of the essence, legumes can still benefit from a quick soak achieved by bringing them to a boil in water, then removing from heat, and letting them stand for at least an hour. Drain and rinse before proceeding.)

Combine legumes with cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, partially covering the pot, and simmer. Check to ensure that the desired tenderness has been achieved, and then remove from heat.





LEMONGRASS


Flavor: sour/sweet, with notes of citrus (e.g., lemon or lemon zest) and/or flowers



Volume: quiet–moderate/loud



What it is: Southeast Asian grass used as a flavoring



Techniques: puree, simmer



Tips: Use fresh. Remove whole stalks after cooking and before serving. Otherwise, puree or slice these fibrous stalks very, very thinly.



Possible substitute: lemon zest

LENTILS—IN GENERAL (see also specific LENTILS)


Season: autumn–winter



Flavor: sweet, with astringent/earthy notes, and textures ranging from firm to mushy when cooked



Volume: moderate



What they are: legumes



Nutritional profile: 70% carbs / 27% protein / 3% fats



Calories: 230 per 1-cup serving (boiled)



Protein: 18 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer (always cook thoroughly)



Timing: Cook until tender, typically less than 30 minutes.



Ratio: 1:2½ (1 cup lentils to 2½ cups cooking liquid, e.g., water)



Tips: Rinse well, and remove any pebbles or small stones before cooking. Unlike other legumes, lentils require no presoaking. Don’t salt the cooking water, which can slow the cooking process. As a general rule, the darker the lentil, the louder the flavor and the firmer the texture.

“I love cooking lentils until they’re soft, then combining them with vegetables—especially onions and mushrooms, but also things like broccoli—and pressing the mixture into a loaf pan and baking it for 40 minutes. After it’s cool, I’ll slice it and serve it with mashed potatoes and gravy.”

“I learned how to make black lentils when I cooked for two years at Bucara in Delhi, which is one of the best Indian restaurants in the world. After soaking them overnight and draining them, we would slow-boil them over low heat for two hours before seasoning them with ginger, garlic paste, tomato puree, salt, chili powder, unsalted butter, and heavy cream. They were so rich and delicious that we’d make 50 or 60 pounds of them every day to serve 300 guests! I still make them the same way today.”

“Red lentils are my favorite lentils. I love their flavor, which is both lentil-y and unique at the same time. And I love how they break down to reach such a creamy texture. I like to cook them Egyptian-style with potatoes, then puree them, seasoning them with cumin, salt, and pepper before finishing them with a squeeze of lemon.”

MEDITERRANEAN CUISINES (see GREEK CUISINE, ITALIAN CUISINE—SOUTHERN, etc.)



“So much Mediterranean food is inherently vegan, which is why we refer to Crossroads as a Mediterranean restaurant. We don’t use the word ‘vegan’ here. This way, the food is not seen as foreign to people who eat here. At Crossroads, people are not eating tofu or tempeh or seitan, whose textures are foreign to most people. While I like tempeh, you are not going to convince someone to go vegan if that is the first thing they try. People need familiar food that is transitional, and that will depend on the person. Our spanakopita or spiced chickpeas are dishes people are already acquainted with, and our risotto is the least threatening dish on the menu and something that people have already had.”

Make Your Own Almond Milk


Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company says it’s easy to make your own delicious almond milk by

soaking raw almonds overnight

draining them

combining soaked almonds with fresh water in a 1:3 ratio in a Vitamix

straining the milk through a fine-mesh nut milk bag

adding cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)



You can also cook down almond milk, adding a pinch of pectin, then chill, to create a yogurt-like almond cream to enjoy on its own or with berries, granola, etc.

Tips: Look for organic coconut milk in cartons (versus cans). The health-conscious can opt for light (both lighter in flavor and lower in fat) or unsweetened coconut milk. Condensed coconut milk can be used for desserts, sauces, and soups.

“We make our own coconut milk–based ice creams and use Irish moss to stabilize them. We’ll even top them with ‘whipped cream’ from a siphon, which is also coconut milk-based. Coconut Bliss is a fantastic Oregon-based dairy-free ‘ice cream’ made with coconut milk and agave, which was recently sold to a dairy.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)




“We have a new vegan truck for selling burgers, and desserts like our Vegan Fat Boys, which are vegan brownies filled with coconut milk–based Coconut Bliss ice cream. The texture is very rich and creamy, not icy, and its flavor is not overpowering.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“We make our ice cream from a blend of coconut milk and soy milk, which prevents the flavor, texture, and color of either milk from interfering with that of the ice cream. The result is a very thick and creamy ice cream.… Our roast pumpkin ice cream is accented mostly by cinnamon, but also allspice, cloves, and nutmeg.… Coconut milk has such a high fat content that all you need to do is add a bit of powdered sugar and run it through a charged canister to have nice, thick whipped cream.”

—KATE JACOBY, VEDGE (PHILADELPHIA)




“Our signature ice cream starts with coconut cream, organic unrefined cane sugar, agave, and a trace amount of plant-based stabilizers (guar and xanthan gum), and works well with exotic spicy and savory flavors, such as toasted pine nut and fennel, or Mexican chocolate with cayenne and cinnamon, or Thai chili peanut. Our nut-based flavors are made with an almond and cashew blend, and work best with more traditional flavors like caramel, chocolate, cookie, peanut butter, and vanilla. Our soft ice cream flavors are made with a soy base.”

—DEENA JALAL, FOMU AND ROOT (ALLSTON, MA)




“Coconut milk is fantastic—it’s saved our lives in being able to serve our vegan guests. We use it a lot in vegan desserts, like our coconut milk panna cotta. The mouthfeel is not the same as when making a dairy panna cotta, so you’ve got to use a bit more vanilla and sugar. And we’ve made mousses by putting a mixture of coconut milk and agar-agar through an iSi whipped cream dispenser.”

MILK, GOAT


Flavor: salty/sour/ sweet



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Can be easier to digest given its lower level of lactose (4.1%) than cow’s milk (4.7%) and the absence of cow’s milk’s main problem-causing protein (alpha SI casein). Sweeten and reduce over medium heat to make cajeta (a thick Mexican caramel sauce).

“We tested lots of different nondairy milks to come up with our recipe for a latte with the creamy richness of cow’s milk, which is half hemp milk and half coconut milk, plus agave nectar as a sweetener, added to two shots of espresso. Either will be good on its own, but the fat from the coconut milk adds great richness, while the hemp milk adds a more understated nutty flavor, and together they foam up really well.”

What it is: whole grain

Nutritional profile: 82% carbs / 11% protein / 7% fat



Calories: 210 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 6 grams



Techniques: dry roast, marinate, pressure-cook, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Simmer about 15–20 minutes (chewier) to 30–40 minutes (softer), until desired tenderness is reached.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup millet to 2–3 cups liquid. Use more liquid for softer texture; also, given its flavor neutrality, use vegetable stock instead of water.)



Tips: Toast before steaming to bring out its flavor. Marinate, or cook risotto-style: Sauté millet before adding liquid to simmer slowly.

“When I opened Verbena [in 1994], I would go to Kalustyan’s [the famed Manhattan spice and specialty food store] and buy unusual grains to serve. Millet was never used at other restaurants at the time. In Verbena’s review in The New York Times, it was referred to as ‘bird seed.’ So you see how much times have changed!”

[MEE-soh]



Flavor: sweet (light miso) and/or salty (dark miso), with earthy/savory notes of cocoa, coffee, malt, nuts, and/or yeast



Volume: quiet (lighter miso, e.g., white, yellow)–loud (darker miso, e.g., red, brown)



What it is: Japanese fermented soybean paste, available in countless different varieties in Japan—as many varieties as there are types of cheese available in the U.S.!



Nutritional profile: 55% carbs / 25% fat / 20% protein



Calories: 275 per ½-cup serving



Protein: 16 grams



Techniques: To protect miso’s nutritional value, never bring to a boil.



Tips: Mix light and dark misos for more complex flavors. Add miso to mashed or pureed vegetables and use as a sauce. Also, customize miso soup by the season; for example, in spring/summer, use light miso + basil + green beans, and in autumn/winter, use dark miso + Brussels sprouts + garlic.

“If green vegetables are the king of Super Immunity, mushrooms are the queen.… White, cremini, portobello, oyster, maitake, and reishi mushrooms have all been shown to have anticancer effects.”

—DR. JOEL FUHRMAN, IN SUPER IMMUNITY




“Bottom line, mushrooms are good medicine. Cook them well before eating them and enjoy a variety rather than any one specific type.”

—DR. ANDREW WEIL, ON DRWEIL.COM




“Raw mushrooms are technically not supposed to be good for you. Also, the texture you get from them when they are cooked is much more exciting than when they are raw. So how do you give your mushrooms flavor without heat [as in raw cuisine]? You do it with citrus and salt because they will bring out a lot of flavor and enhance its texture. If you rub a mushroom with salt, the water comes out and the solids collapse and it becomes soft.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Abalone mushrooms, which are available in August and again in February through April in the Pacific Northwest, are incredibly meaty, meaty mushrooms. They’re giant, about five inches in diameter. I’ll slice them thick, score them, and poach them for an hour in butter, cognac, shallot, garlic, parsley, and thyme until they’re soft, and serve them with candied pistachios.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“I love trumpet mushrooms, which are milder in flavor and have the texture of scallops. They take marinades really well.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“I’ll slice large Trumpet Royale mushrooms into scallops, whose great texture they resemble, although they’re not as yielding or buttery. They can be woody, so I’ll acidulate them with lemon juice, which makes them tender and lovely, and their residual sugar helps with their caramelization when I sauté them in garlic and olive oil.”

“We’ve been making our Hen of the Woods mushroom pâté for years now, and it tastes like wild, foraged maitakes. We sear them in olive oil with caramelized onions, shallots, garlic, thyme, mushroom stock, and port (like traditional pâté), and finish them with mascarpone and truffle oil. We use agar-agar to make a port gelée.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“We serve a roasted maitake mushroom with celery root fritter and grilled leek rémoulade. We love the texture of the mushroom because it is a wedge, so you get the singed, frilly little edge of the mushroom along with the juicy succulent base.”

—ERIC TUCKER, MILLENNIUM (SAN FRANCISCO)




“There may be no more prized ingredient in Japanese cuisine than matsutake mushrooms. They are as celebrated in Japan as truffles are in Italy or France. I love the texture of the mushroom, and will never forget a shockingly good version of a sukiyaki dish I tasted that featured them. But that dish was like a short-distance dash—and I like serving them cooked in a pot as a dobin mushi, which really celebrates their lasting flavor and is more like a long-distance marathon.”

“The inspiration for my artichoke oysters dish [which is served with artichoke puree, crispy oyster mushrooms, yellow tomato béarnaise, and kelp caviar] came from peeling an artichoke one day. I was peeling the leaves and one fell on a plate on its back and it looked like an oyster shell. One of the things I love to do is re-create dishes I love that I miss being a vegan and dishes that are unexpected in a vegan diet. The inspiration was nature, and it turned into ‘oysters Rockefeller.’ ”

To reconstitute, soak in hot water for 20–30 minutes before adding to dishes; the flavored water can be strained and added to sauces, soups, or stews.

Chef Colin Bedford of North Carolina’s Fearrington House on Mushrooms


At the Fearrington House, we treat mushrooms very much like meat. We will take larger king oyster or maitake mushrooms and confit them whole in olive oil, or we will sous-vide them as that is another great technique to infuse flavor and to create layers of flavors. The flavors differ throughout the year. In March, we use thyme, garlic, and white wine, as the wine really brightens the flavor.

King Oysters are nice, big, fat mushrooms. We will confit them with garlic, bay leaf, and thyme. The ratio of stalk to cap is crazy—like 5 percent cap to 95 percent stalk, so we use the stalk for carpaccio, cooking the mushrooms at 85°C for one to one-and-a-half hours with lots of aromatics. Once they are cool, we slice them thin on a mandoline and lay them on the plate. With the dish, we add crosnes, which are like a really cool artichoke; sunchokes, roasted cippolini onions, and garlic chips for a crispy texture.

Maitake mushrooms are my favorite. They have a meaty quality and are so versatile. We will confit them whole. Sunchokes work really well with them, as does ginger, which gives it a warm, earthy tone—with fresh ginger adding heat, and candied ginger mellowing the flavor. I’ll also use sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup—we use Mikuni Wild Harvest’s NOBLE maple syrup.

Chanterelles are another favorite. Thyme is one of my favorite pairings, as is sage; I will use one or the other. In the fall or winter, black garlic also works well with them: We will caramelize and puree the garlic, which has a kind of fermented quality that brings up sweetness, and from there we will add some Madeira and maple [syrup] for more flavor. Chanterelles are a mushroom that we don’t cook to order. We like to cook them beforehand and stew them down with aromatics, butter, and just a pinch of white wine at the end to balance the flavors.

Matsutakes call for keeping it simple, so we don’t mess around with them too much, and simply confit them. After they are cooked, we will score and then pan sear them so you get that contrasting texture.

Doubloons are smaller than shiitake mushrooms, but we treat them the same way.





Pickling Mushrooms with Colin Bedford


Beech mushrooms are perfect for pickling, as they are essentially sponges. A cremini would be too hard; you would just get little nuggets. When pickling mushrooms, the pickling solution will depend on the season, which will influence our choice of vinegar—for example:

• Autumn: madeira and sherry vinegars

• Winter: port wine, red wine, and raspberry vinegars

• Spring: lemon and chardonnay vinegars

• Summer: white balsamic and champagne vinegars





MUSTARD, e.g., DIJON (see also GREENS, MUSTARD; MUSTARD POWDER; MUSTARD SEEDS)


Flavor: bitter; hot, with peppery, spicy notes



Volume: moderate–very loud



Tips: For most purposes, choose Dijon mustard (made with verjus instead of vinegar); other options include stone-ground and/or whole-grain mustard. Add mustard at the end of the cooking process.

What it is: ground mustard seeds



Tips: Use within six months, as it loses its potency. Mix with cold water (to maintain “loudness”; alternatively, use hot water to quiet the heat) to form a hot mustard paste; let stand 10–15 minutes before using. Alternatively, mix with beer or white wine.

“During a kaiseki menu, you want to make a certain impact with the very first course, and to make sure the main course itself is outstanding. But the courses before and after the main course should be toned down, to enhance its impact. I would serve something very simple and delicious before the main course, like soba noodles.”

Flavor: salty, with notes of the sea, and the texture of handmade paper



Volume: quiet (as is)–moderate (after toasting)



What it is: dried and pressed sheets of seaweed, typically used to wrap sushi, hand rolls, and nori (aka maki) rolls



What’s healthful about it: easy to digest; higher in protein than any other seaweed



Nutritional profile: 53% carbs / 40% protein / 7% fats



Calories: 1 calorie per sheet



Tips: Lightly toast the dried seaweed sheet before using, by waving it over an open flame on your stovetop, which enhances its flavor and texture. At traditional sushi restaurants, vegetarian options typically include white or brown short-grain sticky rice rolls filled with avocado and/or cucumber. However, New York City’s Beyond Sushi features iron-rich six-grain rice—a delicious medley of rye berries, barley, pearl barley, brown rice, red rice, and black rice.

I will also add nutmeg to the yam I make with cinnamon, bay leaf, thyme, and few other ingredients. I will also add it to potatoes, cream, garlic, and thyme. It even works with sautéed spinach and greens as balance to the bitterness.”

Calories: 110 per 1-ounce serving (uncooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer



Timing: Cook Scottish oats about 10 minutes, or old-fashioned (aka rolled) oats about 10–15 minutes, covered; steel-cut oats will cook in about 30 minutes, although cooking time can be cut by presoaking.



Ratio: 1: 2–3 (1 cup oats to 2–3 cups liquid, e.g., almond milk or water)



Tips: To make a creamier oatmeal, use Scottish oats and/or substitute milk (e.g., almond) for some or all of the water. For chewier oatmeal, opt for steel-cut oats. In-between? You might prefer good old-fashioned rolled oats. Whole oat groats can be used in savory dishes, such as pilafs.

OIL—IN GENERAL


Virtually all oils have about 120 calories per 1-tablespoon serving, and are high in fats and low in nutrients.



Tips: Select an oil based on its intended purpose, e.g., finishing dishes (e.g., extra-virgin olive, flavored), or low-, medium-, or high-temperature (e.g., grapeseed, peanut, safflower) cooking. Always opt for unrefined and less processed oils (e.g., “expeller-pressed” or “cold pressed”), which are free of chemicals and solvents, and choose organic corn and soybean oils.





OIL, ACORN SQUASH SEED


Flavor: earthy notes of brown butter, chestnuts, spice, squash, and/or toasted walnuts, and a rich texture



Volume: moderate

OIL, CANOLA


Flavor: neutral



Volume: quiet



What it is: rapeseed oil from CANada (which is where it gets its name)



Techniques: bake, fry, sauté



Tips: Use only organic, expeller-pressed canola oil, as many canola oils are made from GMO seeds; otherwise, opt for another oil altogether. Use as fresh as possible, and check regularly for rancidity (as it goes rancid quickly). Canola oil can be used for medium- (e.g., baking) to high-temperature (e.g., frying) cooking. Use with boldly flavored dishes that would obscure the flavor of more expensive oils.

“The choice of oil in baking is important. For cookies I will use canola, grapeseed, or coconut oil. The coconut oil is used in our doughnuts and cakes as well, but you have to be careful so that the flavor does not become overpowering.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Coconut oil is a liquid when it’s at 72°F and up, and a solid with the texture of butter or shortening at temperatures below 72°F. When we make biscuits, we’ll use solid coconut oil and cut it into the dough, which results in a layering effect and flakier biscuits. We’ll also cut solid coconut oil into our pancake batter, where it has a leavening effect that makes our pancakes light and fluffy—more so than with canola oil.”

“The flavor of olive oil can sometimes be overpowering, so I will often use grapeseed oil—which has a nice, neutral flavor—in a ratio of two parts grapeseed oil to one part olive oil.”

OIL, OLIVE


Flavor: earthy notes of fruit and/or olives, with a rich texture



Volume: quieter (e.g., lighter-colored virgin)–louder (e.g., deeper-colored extra-virgin)



Techniques: bake, fry, raw, sauté (on low heat)



Tips: Use raw, or warm only to low temperatures. Opt for lighter, quieter virgin (aka “pure”) oil for baking, frying, grilling, roasting, and sautéing, and darker, louder extra-virgin oil for dressing salads or drizzling on bruschetta or pizza. For salad dressings, the typical ratio is one part vinegar to three or four parts extra-virgin olive oil, but those looking to lower the fat in their diets (not to mention calories) should consider using less oil.

“I can sum up in two words the difference between vegetarian cooking in the 1970s vs. today: olive oil. Back then, it was common to mask dishes with the richness of butter and cream. Olive oil lets more of the flavor shine through, particularly dishes made with garlic and herbs.”

—MOLLIE KATZEN, AUTHOR




“One you’ve fallen in love with the flavor of extra-virgin olive oil, there’s no place to go after that. I’ll only use it to finish dishes. For high-heat cooking, I use canola, grapeseed, or safflower oil—or some combination thereof.”

OIL SUBSTITUTES


Tips: When baking sweets (e.g., cakes, cookies, cupcakes, muffins, etc.), substitute 1 cup of fruit puree for each cup of oil called for in the recipe. You can use applesauce or other fruit purees (e.g., banana, prune, pumpkin), and even pureed black beans in dark-colored baked goods such as brownies and chocolate cakes. Substitute vegetable stock for oil when sautéing garlic, onions, or other vegetables.

ORGANIC PRODUCE


Tip: Opt for organic produce whenever possible—and definitely when you buy one of the Environmental Working Group (EWG)’s so-called “Dirty Dozen Plus” fruits or vegetables, which are those most affected by chemical contamination, i.e., apples, bell peppers, celery, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers, collard greens, cucumbers, grapes, kale, nectarines (imported), peaches, potatoes, spinach, strawberries, and summer squash.



The EWG notes that “[t]he health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure. Use EWG’s Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides™ to reduce your exposures as much as possible, but eating conventionally-grown produce is far better than not eating fruits and vegetables at all.”

“I love parsley as a flavor. Parsley risotto is amazing, and its color is as vibrant as its flavor. There is more to parsley than just the leaf; I use the stems and roots as well. The stems add good texture, and I use them to add crunch to soups. As for the root, which has an herbaceousness similar to parsnips, I like to roast and puree them for soups as well.… People also need to remember that there is more than flat-leaf parsley out there. I am a fan of curly parsley, which is often overlooked and has an intense, almost celery-like flavor. There was a time in America when you couldn’t serve a plate without the orange wedge and curly parsley.”

“I’ve made parsnip jam by seasoning it with vanilla and rice wine vinegar.”

—MARK LEVY, THE POINT (SARANAC LAKE, NY)




“If I’m serving a smooth pureed parsnip soup, I’ll layer other parsnip flavors into the dish—for example, both cooked and raw parsnips, fried parsnip chips, and a confited parsnip ‘butter.’ I’ll keep working to think of new ways to get more parsnip flavor into the dish one more time—like taking the parsnip oil from confited parsnips and reemulsifying it back into the soup. All together, the flavor becomes so much more impactful.”

PASTA—WHOLE-GRAIN, IN GENERAL


What it is: whole-grain product (refined)



Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 15% protein / 4% fats



Calories: 175 per 1-cup serving (whole-wheat spaghetti, cooked)



Protein: 7 grams



Tips: There are more whole-grain varieties than ever, including brown rice, buckwheat, corn, oat, quinoa, rice, spelt, whole-wheat, etc. Experiment with various shapes, e.g., penne, rotini, shells, etc.



Possible substitutes: spiralized vegetables (e.g., zucchini) instead of linguini, spaghetti, etc.; sliced vegetables (e.g., eggplant, summer squash, sweet potato) instead of lasagna noodles





“There are entire regions of Italy that make pasta without eggs. Gnocchi is made without eggs in Liguria [so it’s naturally vegan]. I don’t use eggs in my ravioli dough—I use tapioca flour. I sometimes stuff ravioli with thick cashew cream, or kale, or a vegetable puree. I’ve served English pea ravioli with morels, mint, lemon zest, and sweated shallots.”

—AARON ADAMS, PORTOBELLO (PORTLAND, OR)




“Pastas are a good way to get people to try a vegan dish in a vegan restaurant. Pizzas, too. They’re a friendly entry point that can help to pull people in, and when they’re served with ingredients like heirloom tomatoes or pestos, they’re not intimidating.”

Talking with Chef Chris Eddy of Winvian about Cooking for Vegetarians


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was a simple vegetarian pappardelle dish I was served at Winvian, a unique Connecticut resort that houses eighteen individually designed cottages, including a helicopter and a treehouse. It featured a green sauce, along with sautéed cauliflower, mushrooms, and onions, and a very light dusting of grated cheese on top. The creamy sauce turned out to be a steamed broccoli puree made in a Vitamix with a bit of ice (“to cool the broccoli as quickly as possible,” according to chef Chris Eddy), some clear vegetable stock (“so as not to interfere with the beautiful green color”), a hint of heat in the form of either cayenne or chili pepper flakes (“always—it’s a ‘calling card’ that leaves an impression even after you’ve finished eating”), and just a touch of brown butter (“to add an amazing dimension to the sauce”). It’s based on a “ridiculously simple” technique Eddy learned while working with Chef Alain Ducasse and, I can attest, it’s ridiculously delicious.

Eddy says the technique works just as well with other vegetables—whether cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, or parsnips—and if added richness is desired, one could substitute cream for some of the clear vegetable stock (“although its whiteness fades the bright colors”), though the dish is creamy and rich even without added cream.

While Eddy characterizes Winvian’s customers as about 35 to 40 percent pescetarian, he and chef de cuisine Patrick Espinoza and their kitchen team spent a month eating vegetarian during the summer of 2013, just for the experience of putting themselves into the shoes of the significant portion of Winvian’s clientele (“about 7 or 8 percent of our customers”) who eat vegetarian. Why? “Number one, we love vegetables,” Eddy admits. But out of compassion for Winvian’s vegetarian customers, “We wanted to ‘feel their pain.’ We came to understand their frustration [at other restaurants] of only being offered the same dishes again and again—whether eggplant Parmesan, or risotto, or a salad—when they went out to dine.” In addition to prompting Eddy and his team to come up with an ever-changing array of dishes like the incredible pappardelle I fell in love with, their month-long vegetarian experiment had an added bonus: a number of Eddy’s cooks discovered that they felt healthier and sometimes less irritable.

“Now, we like to go all out for our vegetarian guests, and give them something special,” says Eddy. Mission accomplished.

“With some vegetables there is a real need for speed [i.e., getting them from the garden to the table], and corn and peas are the greatest examples. Fresh peas are the world’s greatest. I love risotto or pasta with fresh peas.”

—CHRISTOPHER BATES, HOTEL FAUCHÈRE (MILFORD, PA)




“There is nothing better than English peas or snap peas that are really sweet. I like to make a pea and radish salad with pea tendrils, pea shoots, and a bright lemon olive oil dressing.”

Flavor: hot (and sometimes sweet); aromatic, with pungent notes of cloves, lemon, and/or wood



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Look for tellicherry black peppercorns, which are often regarded as the best in the world for their rich, complex flavor. Pepper suggests “false heat,” and also stimulates the appetite. Always use freshly ground black pepper from a pepper mill for optimal flavor. Add at the very last minute before serving.

“I think black pepper and the whole rainbow of peppercorns are among the most underrated spices in the kitchen. Peppercorns are truly berries—they are sweet, fruity, and spicy—so a great pepper adds a lot of flavor. I’ve served cauliflower crusted with pepper, and the pepper helped the cauliflower sing on the plate.”

“My personal preference is to serve fruit only at the end of a meal, but persimmons are an exception: They are not too sweet, and not too overwhelming in flavor, so they are easy to use at other points in a meal. I’ve served a mid-menu dish of chilled persimmon with tofu paste, and I also think sesame paste accents it well.”

“All Jamaicans grow up eating pineapple chicken. I love making [vegan] pineapple stew, sautéing vegetables with pineapple, white rum, and brown sugar, with a dash of either apple cider or red wine vinegar, so that the stew is sweet and spicy and tangy.”

Season: winter



Flavor: sour/sweet, with grapefruit notes (although milder, sweeter, and juicier than grapefruit)



Volume: loud



What it is: citrus fruit





POPCORN, e.g., air-popped


What it is: whole grain



What’s healthful about it: high in fiber, low in calories (when air-popped)



Tips: Opt for organic popcorn, as non-organic popcorn is on the USDA’s top 10 list of foods contaminated with toxic chemicals and pesticides. Spritz with a little soy sauce for flavor and saltiness—or with a little olive oil and a sprinkle of cheesy-tasting nutritional yeast for a dose of vitamin B12.

Washington Post food editor Joe Yonan, author of Eat Your Vegetables, created his own version of the addictive herbed popcorn produced by Seventh-day Adventist vegetarian restaurant Little Lad’s, which features oil-popped popcorn seasoned with nutritional yeast, dried oregano, dried dill, dried thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, and an optional shake of fine sea salt.

Tips: Opt for organic potatoes. Leave the skins on for extra flavor, texture, and nutrition. Scrub well before cooking. Boil potatoes whole, not cut, so they don’t absorb water. Before baking potatoes, poke with a fork several times so steam can escape. Potatoes are America’s favorite vegetable (especially as French fries!), but don’t forget the importance of enjoying a wide variety of vegetables to ensure yourself the benefits of an equally wide variety of nutrients.

PRESSURE-COOKING


Tip: Cooks foods 50–70 percent faster than traditional methods—which is especially helpful when it comes to slow-cooking foods such as dried beans and grains.





“I love pressure-cooking beans and grains, not only because it’s faster but because it makes them more digestible. Chickpeas that would normally take hours and hours of boiling will be done in 60 minutes in a pressure-cooker. The only beans I won’t pressure-cook are white beans, because it makes them too mushy for our arugula salad that features them. And you shouldn’t pressure-cook split peas or soybeans because they foam, which can clog the mechanism and make it explode—something I unfortunately learned the hard way after just painting my kitchen.… Brown rice can pressure-cook in just 40 minutes, and only needs a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio, because you don’t need much liquid when pressure-cooking.”

“With up to 9 grams of protein per half-cup serving, pulses offer a low-fat or fat-free alternative to animal proteins. Pulses improve the protein quality of cereal grains, by adding a complimentary amino acid profile. Due to the high nutrient density, pulses can be considered both a protein and a vegetable.”

QUINOA


[KEEN-wah]



Flavor: bitter/slightly sweet, with earthy notes of couscous, grass, herbs, millet, nuts, and/or sesame, and a light and fluffy (when cooked), slightly crunchy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: often thought of as a whole grain, even though it’s the fruit of an herb, not a grain



What’s healthful about it: Most quinoa contains 15–20% protein (higher than the typical 14% of wheat, 9–11% of millet, and 7–8% of rice), and is richer in calcium than milk.



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 71% carbs / 15% protein / 14% fat



Calories: 220 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 8 grams



Techniques: boil, simmer, steam, toast



Timing: Cooks in 10–15 (white) to 20 (red) to 30 (black) minutes.



Ratio: 1: 1½–2 (1 cup quinoa to 1½–2 cups liquid, e.g., stock, water)



Tips: Quinoa must be rinsed very well before cooking, to remove all traces of bitterness (and “suds” from the rinse water). Toast first before using in dishes to enhance its flavor. For enhanced flavor and texture, try sautéing for 5 minutes before adding liquid—and/or substituting vegetable stock or juice, or fruit juice (e.g., orange or passion fruit), for some or all of the water. Fluff with a fork after cooking to separate the grains (and remember that black and red quinoa won’t stick together as much as white). Quinoa doesn’t get mushy, even when overcooked.

“Eating plain white quinoa can be like eating bird food. What I like to do is mix it with red and black quinoa, which gives you great flavor and texture with some nuttiness and chew to it.”

—CHARLEEN BADMAN, FnB RESTAURANT (SCOTTSDALE, AZ)




“I love quinoa. I especially like making quinoa tabbolueh. I add onions, tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, lemon, and salt. You don’t have to cook it that long and it absorbs all the flavors.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Every ingredient in our dishes is there for a reason—either flavor, texture, and/or its health benefit. Quinoa is kind of our ‘house grain’ because of all of the above—it’s great in salads, and golden quinoa is one of two key ingredients [along with black beans] in our signature Root veggie burger. Our burgers are also made with pureed carrots, garlic, onions, and breadcrumbs seasoned with black pepper and paprika before shaping into patties. To achieve their meaty texture, they’re cooked twice—the first time slowly on low heat on the grill, and the second time seared on high heat to crisp it.”

—Canyon Ranch Grill (Las Vegas)





RICE, ARBORIO (aka RISOTTO)


Flavor: neutral, with a firm chalky center and a starchy, creamy surface (when cooked)



Volume: quiet



Techniques: Sauté rice in butter or oil until white. Stir while gradually adding hot/boiling liquid (e.g., vegetable stock) and simmering, about 20 minutes.



Ratio: 1: 3–3½ (1 cup rice to 3–3½ cups cooking liquid, e.g., juice, stock, water, and/or wine)



Tips: Let the seasons inspire your risotto pairings, e.g., basil and tomato in summer, wild mushrooms in autumn. Try the same flavor pairings with “risottos” made from other grains, e.g., barley, farro. Look for brown Arborio rice, which is higher in nutrients.

RICE, BASMATI, and BROWN BASMATI RICE


Flavor: slightly sweet; aromatic, with notes of nuts, popcorn, smoke, and/or toast, and a firm, slightly chewy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: aged long-grain rice



Techniques: boil, simmer (about 2 minutes), steam



Timing: Simmer, covered, about 20 (white) to 40 (brown) minutes.



Ratio: 1: 1½ (white)–2 (brown) (1 cup rice to 1½–2 cups cooking liquid)



Tips: Rinse basmati rice before using. Soak it for 10 minutes before cooking in enough water to “reach your first knuckle,” according to Hemant Mathur of Tulsi.

RICE, BROWN—IN GENERAL


Flavor: nutty, with a chewy texture



Volume: quiet–moderate



What it is: whole grain



Nutritional profile: 87% carbs / 7% protein / 6% fat



Calories: 220 per 1-cup serving (medium-grain, cooked)



Protein: 5 grams



Timing: Cook at a low boil, covered, for about 30–50 minutes, until tender.



Ratio: 1:2 (1 cup brown rice to 2 cups of cooking liquid)



Tips: Because brown rice takes so long to cook, make sure you cook extra. You can freeze the leftovers, then reheat the frozen rice in about 10 minutes on the stove. If you’re short on time, quick brown rice cooks in about 10–15 minutes.

Flavor: bitter/sweet, with complex earthy/savory notes of grass and/or NUTS, and a very chewy texture



Volume: moderate–loud



What it is: considered a whole grain, even though it is technically a seed (of aquatic grass) and not in the botanical grain family



What’s healthful about it: twice the fiber and protein of brown rice



Gluten-free: yes



Nutritional profile: 83% carbs / 14% protein / 3% fats



Calories: 170 per 1-cup serving (cooked)



Protein: 7 grams



Techniques: pressure-cook (20–25 minutes), simmer (covered, 35–60 minutes), steam



Ratio: 1: 3–4 (1 cup wild rice to 3–4 cups cooking liquid)



Tips: Rinse wild rice thoroughly before cooking. Combine with other rice(s) to lessen its chewiness.



Factoid: It is the only native North American grain.

“I’ll confit root vegetables—like carrots, celery root, parsley root, and parsnips—that have been shaved thin on a mandoline in olive oil with herbs, spices, and citrus for six to eight hours in an 85°F oven, which breaks down their cell wall structure. As they become tender, their water is replaced with fat. I strain and puree them, which creates the texture of room-temperature butter. Because this ‘root vegetable butter’ has the same qualities as butter or soft cheese, I can use it in similar ways, such as on canapés or to bind other ingredients.”

“Anytime you combine rosemary and thyme, you’ve got instant Thanksgiving! Their soulful, dark, rich flavors will enhance anything, from a bag of chips to a mushroom dish. But rosemary is very pungent, so you only need a little. I won’t add rosemary to a soup: by the time rosemary turns gray, it’s given everything it has to give, and you want it out of there anyway. Instead, I’ll use a rosemary branch to stir the soup and infuse the flavor.”

RUTABAGAS


Season: autumn–spring



Flavor: sweet/sometimes bitter, with sometimes sharp, peppery, and/or pungent notes of cabbage, nuts, and/or turnips, and a crisp texture



Volume: moderate (esp. cooked)–loud (esp. raw)



What they are: root vegetables



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 9% protein / 5% fats



Calories: 70 per 1-cup serving (cooked, cubed)



Protein: 2 grams



Techniques: bake (at 350°F for 50–60 minutes), blanch, boil, braise, deep-fry, grate, hash, julienne, marinate, mash, pressure-cook, puree, roast, sauté, shred, steam (10–15 minutes), stew, stir-fry



Tips: Do not undercook. The longer it cooks, the sweeter the flavor, but do not overcook. Add a touch of sweetness (e.g., sugar) to counteract bitterness. Puree with quieter vegetables, e.g., potatoes.

“Every dish needs a vibrant quality about it. In a leafy green salad, when you toss it and serve it, it doesn’t have the leaves all upside down so their backs are to someone. I call it ‘fluffy and lofty’—the greens twins—that make the salad inviting. If you list a bunch of ingredients in the salad, don’t hide them all at the bottom. Make sure the stand-out ingredients stand out. And don’t go cheap: three extra cherry tomatoes is not going to break the bank. You want a person to feel that you care every step of the way.”

—ANNIE SOMERVILLE, GREENS RESTAURANT (SAN FRANCISCO)





The Secret to Loving Salads: A Great Salad Dressing


One of the most healthful and flavorful changes you can make to your diet is to eat more vegetables—a lot more vegetables. At least half of them should be eaten raw, such as in salads. Keeping things flavorful through mastering a compelling array of salad dressings is a worthwhile pursuit.

Don’t undo the good you’ve done by using typical oil-laden dressings, which clock in at nearly 120 calories per tablespoon (like pure fat itself). Below are some ways to cut calories and fat without eliminating flavor:


Ratio: The standard radio is 1:3 or 1:4 (1 part vinegar to 3 or 4 parts oil), but consider minimizing (if not eliminating) oil in salad dressings.


Tips: Always start the process of making salad dressing with the vinegar and/or citrus (e.g., lemon, lime, orange) juice and seasonings (e.g., citrus zest, herbs; minced garlic, onions, or shallots; spices), and slowly whisk in any oil. If too much oil is added, the flavor balance will be lost. For more Omega-3s, consider substituting flaxseed or walnut oil for part of the extra-virgin olive oil. With citrus vinaigrettes, use a lighter vinegar, e.g., champagne, rice, or sherry. Those looking to minimize or eliminate oil can base salad dressings on other liquids or pastes, such as buttermilk, fruit juice, kefir, nut butters, tahini, vegetable juice or stock, vinegar, yogurt, and/or water—or even pureed fruit, silken tofu, or vegetables (e.g., avocados). To make vegetarian dressings creamier, add a little cream cheese, fresh goat cheese, kefir, mascarpone, or ricotta; vegans can blend with nutritional yeast or silken tofu.

Not only great for salads, the combinations listed in this section can also be used for dips, dipping sauces, marinades, sautés, or stir-fries—or drizzled over hot vegetables, Asian noodles, or pastas.





Talking with Charleen Badman of FnB in Scottsdale about Making a Great Salad


For a great salad, you need the elements of crunch, sweetness, savoriness, and fattiness.

Crunch: “For crunch in a salad, I can use a variety of things beyond nuts. I like to use things in the onion family—for example, julienning and salting onions, and frying them in olive oil. Leeks and shallots both crisp up well and can be used as a garnish. I also like using puffed rice to add texture.”

Sweetness: “Sweetness can be added with fresh fruits, like apples or pears; dried fruits like raisins; or even sweet vegetables like corn or tomatoes.”

Savoriness: “Adding some spice is also a great way to enhance a salad. You can do it with some chili pepper or even raw fresh ginger, which tastes great with rutabaga.”

Fattiness: “To add fat, there are many options. You can select a fatty vegetable, like an avocado. You can use a mayonnaise turned into aioli. Cheese is good in dressings, as are infused olive oils.”

SALT—IN GENERAL



“Because of my French training, fleur de sel is one of the salts I rely on most. Its flavor is perfect with tomatoes. I’ll use Malden sea salt, which has lots of notes of the ocean, for dishes like roasted root vegetables. Sel gris, which often comes in blue bottles, is strong, and not as fine as other salts. I have nothing against kosher salt, but its flavor is just not what I’m used to working with.”

“If you dry sea lettuce, it tastes just like black truffles—it’s an umami bomb! You can find sea lettuce along the San Mateo coast, and harvest it in the wintertime—just dry it and grind it to a powder to use to season sea vegetable salads or onigiri.”

SEITAN (see also tips for NAMA-FU)


[SAY-tahn]



Flavor: neutral, with a meaty (e.g., chicken cutlet-like) texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: a meat substitute made from wheat gluten, nicknamed “wheat meat”



Nutritional profile: 81% protein / 15% carbs / 4% fat



Calories: 105 calories per 1-ounce serving (vital wheat gluten)



Protein: 21 grams



Techniques: bake, barbecue, fry, grill, marinate, pan-sear, sauté, sear, steam, stew, stir-fry



Tips: For peak flavor, be sure to marinate the seitan for at least a few hours. Add texture through seasoned crusts, e.g., herbs, panko. Use seitan “scraps” for sauces, soups, taco fillings. Seitan also freezes well.

You can easily make your own seitan from scratch with vital wheat gluten, seasoning it to taste (e.g., as you would making your own chorizo or gyros). However, if you’re just getting started, you might try one of Arrowhead Mills’s quick mixes or a Knox Mountain mix. You can also find commercially prepared seitan from national brands like Lightlife and WhiteWave, or local producers like The Bridge (Middleton, CT).

“Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are the holy trinity of vegetarianism. Seitan is my favorite because of its versatility.”

—JOY PIERSON, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I love serving seitan with a crunchy crust, such as crushed cashews, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, or even quinoa. Instead of egg wash, we’ll dip the seitan in a vegan mixture of water, lemon juice, garlic, and nutritional yeast before crusting and sautéing.”

—ANGEL RAMOS, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I don’t know of any other vegetarian restaurant that offered a vegetarian Reuben sandwich before we did. Ours is made with a seitan-based pastrami ‘wheat meat,’ a little sauerkraut, spicy mustard, Thousand Island dressing, and Vegenaise on oversized Jewish rye bread, which you can get with either Swiss cheese, vegan cheese, or—my favorite—cottage-style tofu, which is mashed tofu seasoned with garlic, chives, and onions. I’ve probably eaten two hundred of them over the past ten years. In the beginning, we used to make our Reubens with vegetarian bacon bits, which softened on the sandwich, which was spread with a layer of Vegenaise. But the seitan version is more authentic.”

SMOKING


Tips: It doesn’t take more than 30–60 seconds in a smoker to add a smoked flavor to many foods. You definitely don’t want to oversmoke foods, which makes them bitter and leaves an unpleasant brownish coating. Experiment with various woods for different flavors, but you’ll typically want to lean toward lighter woods like apple and cherry (which are sweeter), or perhaps oak and pecan (which are a bit louder), rather than hickory, maple, and mesquite (which are much more pronounced and can easily overwhelm fruits and vegetables).





Brand: Nordic Ware and other companies for small stovetop/grilltop smokers




“I like smoked flavors and smoke lots of different fruits and vegetables. Smoked lettuce has the flavor of a grilled hamburger. It’s comical how convincing it can be: Customers have accused us of putting bacon into our smoked potato puree dish, which evokes bacon and eggs. We’ll smoke garlic or onions and puree them for sauces—or to add a bacony note to pasta alla carbonara. Customers automatically expect raisins to taste dry, chewy, and sweet—but serving them raisins that have been pickled then smoked will make them think again.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“Sometimes I’ll add a little tequila to a black bean sauce to give it a unique smoky flavor—a sauce that would be delicious with chile-grilled seitan with collard greens and sweet plantains.”

SMOOTHIES (see also JUICES)


What they are: differentiated from juices in that they contain fiber, which makes them creamy and more nutritious.



Tips: When in doubt, add a banana for texture and flavor; they combine well with many other fruits and even vegetables. For richer-tasting smoothies, use frozen fruit.





“Smoothies made with tropical fruits will hide the flavor of strong greens. One of our most popular smoothies is the Island Green, which is made with coconut, coconut water, cucumber, kale, mango, pineapple, spinach, and strawberries.”

—CASSIE AND MARLENE TOLMAN, POMEGRANATE CAFÉ (PHOENIX)




“The seasons are an inspiration to all of us here. One autumn, I came up with an ideal seasonal treat: a sweet potato smoothie flavored with maple syrup, almond milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Every fall, we bring it back!”

“Zucchini ‘noodles’ are soft and pliable—especially if blanched in lemon juice, which gives them a soft ‘cooked’ texture—making them the #1 raw pasta option. While using a spiralizer produces a more realistic noodle, using a mandoline is fine if you’re pressed for time.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)





SPIRALING or SPIRALIZING


Use a spiral slicer to create “pasta” (e.g., “angel hair,” “linguini,” “spaghetti”) or thin ribbons out of hard vegetables (e.g., beets, carrots, celery root, daikon, jícama, kohlrabi, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, zucchini) or even fruits (e.g., apples). To soften, toss with a bit of oil and salt (or sauté very briefly) before saucing or adding to soup.


Possible substitutes: julienne peelers, mandolines





Dishes


Housemade Coconut Curry, Jícama Noodles, Garlic Chives, Ube, Roasted Shiitake

—Green Zebra (Chicago)





“I’ll use a spiralizer to make ‘noodles’ like vermicelli from raw kohlrabi or zucchini or other vegetables. Just massage them with a little oil and salt, and in just one minute, the noodles are no longer crunchy but chewy.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Spiralized jícama looks like pho noodles. I’ll add them to a vegetarian pho [Vietnamese noodle soup], or a mushroom curry made with roasted shiitakes and purple sweet potatoes, with the red curry sauce poured tableside.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)

“When I see ramps come in, I know there is light at the end of the tunnel—and that I will not be using squash and potatoes much longer! I look forward to spring’s asparagus and morels, which grow in the Midwest. When June hits, it is strawberry season.”

—JON DUBOIS, GREEN ZEBRA (CHICAGO)




“In the spring, asparagus is the first thing to roll in, then the peas, followed by the fava beans. We are lucky and spoiled here at Greens because we get great produce all year and we know it. It would be hard to do what we do anywhere else!”

“We’ve juiced butternut squash to add color and flavor to risotto. I don’t like the mouthfeel that results from drying and powdering the [leftover] mulch to flavor dishes. But I’ve made a butternut squash chutney out of adding the juice back to the mulch and seasoning it with cardamom, garlic, star anise, sugar, and vinegar.”

SQUASH, SPAGHETTI


Season: late summer–winter



Flavor: slightly sweet, with the texture of crunchy (if stringy) spaghetti



Volume: quiet–moderate



Nutritional profile: 86% carbs / 8% fats / 6% protein



Calories: 45 per 1-cup serving (boiled or baked)



Protein: 1 gram



Techniques: bake (at 350°F about 30–90 minutes), boil (about 30–60 minutes), roast (at 400°F for 15–20 minutes), sauté, steam (20–45 minutes, until tender)



Tips: Spaghetti squash is named after the appearance of its cooked flesh, whose strands resemble the pasta. You can bake it whole (as some insist on), after puncturing it in a few places to allow steam to escape, or halved (as Andrew taught me). Use a fork to pull off strands of cooked squash. Toss or top with sauce and serve like spaghetti. Although spaghetti squash can be found as early as late summer, look to pairing tips for winter squash, which its flavor more closely resembles.

STOCK, VEGETABLE (see also DASHI)


Tips: Vegetable stock is a great staple to have on hand as a base for grains, legumes, marinades, rices, risottos, sauces, or soups. It’s easy to make by simmering your favorite combination of several of the vegetables and seasonings below with water. To make a louder version, roast the vegetables first. As a low-fat substitute, use vegetable stock instead of oil when sautéing or stir-frying foods.

SWEETNESS / SWEETENERS


Tips: The colder the food or the drink, the less the perception of sweetness. Sweetness tends to round out flavors, while acidity sharpens them. There are lots of ways to add it to a dish other than with refined white sugar: Below are some examples.



agave nectar, e.g., raw

apple juice and applesauce

barley malt syrup

brown rice syrup

cane juice, evaporated

cinnamon

coconut nectar

coconut sugar

dates and date sugar

fruit, fresh, e.g., bananas

fruit, dried, e.g., dates, raisins

fruit juice, esp. concentrated, e.g., fruit syrup

fruit preserves and jams

honey, e.g., raw

maple sugar

maple syrup

mirin

“Our tapioca puddings are so popular that it’s hard to take them off our menu. Coconut milk is a source of both flavor and richness [as opposed to rice milk, which is thin and has no flavor, or soy milk, which can taste chalky]. We thicken the pudding with agar-agar, which doesn’t mask flavors, unlike cornstarch. We like to accent it with fruit in both raw and cooked form, such as fresh cherries with a cherry sauce or gel.”

“Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are the holy trinity of vegetarianism.… Tempeh is my favorite because it has the most nutrients.”

—BART POTENZA, COFOUNDER, CANDLE 79 (NEW YORK CITY)




“I prefer soy tempeh in the summertime, because it pairs well with lighter flavors like citrus, lemon, and white wine. When the weather cools down in the fall, I prefer multigrain tempeh because its earthier flavor pairs better with the season’s richer flavors of mushrooms and spices like cinnamon. I really like Surata [brand] tempeh’s texture and flavor.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)

THANKSGIVING



“If you ask people what they love about Thanksgiving food, the answer is usually what we think of as the ‘sides.’ It’s all about the herbs and spices; the sage in the stuffing and the ginger in the squash; the thyme in the gravy and the pepper in the potatoes. There are so many ways to build satisfying flavors for the holiday table. I love a nice centerpiece of course, perhaps a pot pie or a lentil roast, but I think that making sure that all of the familiar flavors are present is the most important part of the holiday table.”

THICKENING AGENTS


When you can’t or don’t want to rely on butter and cream to thicken dishes, consider these options:



agar-agar (although this works better as a gelatin substitute)

arrowroot powder

cornstarch

kudzu root (aka kuzu)





THYME


Season: summer



Flavor: bitter/sweet; aromatic, with earthy/pungent notes of caraway, cloves, flowers, herbs, lemon, mint, orange, and/or pine



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: Opt for fresh rather than dried thyme. Add at the end of the cooking process to retain flavor. Lemon thyme has more citrus notes than regular thyme.

TOFU—IN GENERAL


[TOH-foo]



Flavor: neutral, ranging from delicate to firm in texture



Volume: quiet



What it is: bean curd made from soybeans



Nutritional profile: 50% fats / 38% protein / 12% carbs (raw, firm)



Calories: 185 per ½-cup serving (raw, firm)



Protein: 20 grams (raw, firm)



Techniques: bake (at 350°F for 15 minutes per side), blanch (esp. before long simmering), boil (10 minutes), braise, broil, crumble, cube, freeze (after defrosting, chewiness is enhanced), fry, grill (4–5 minutes per side), marinate, pan-sear, puree, roast, sauté, slice, simmer (20 minutes), stir-fry, tempura-fry, toast



Tips: Its flavor neutrality is a boon, as tofu readily absorbs the flavors with which it is cooked. Tofu is solidified using nigari or lemon juice, so flavors that pair well with lemon often work beautifully. Rinse tofu in cold water before using, and drain well to better allow tofu to absorb seasonings. You can press out the excess water from tofu by using paper towels and heavy books or cans, but frequent tofu cooks might consider investing in a tofu press (e.g., TofuXpress).

TOFU, FIRM or EXTRA-FIRM


Flavor: neutral, with a texture that is denser and heartier than silken, yet moister than super-firm tofu



Volume: quiet



Nutritional profile: 54% fat / 38% protein / 8% carbs



Calories: 85 per -block serving (extra-firm)



Protein: 9 grams (extra-firm)



Techniques: bake, crumble, deep-fry, fry, grate (esp. extra-firm), grill, marinate, pan-fry, roast, sauté, scramble, stir-fry



Tips: Marinate overnight or for as long as several days. For a chewier texture, freeze firm or extra-firm tofu for 24+ hours, then thaw, and squeeze out water in tofu before marinating; the texture can approximate that of ground beef or chicken in dishes such as vegetarian chili or tacos. Crumble and season (e.g., with basil, garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, oregano, salt) extra-firm tofu to make a vegan ricotta cheese substitute that can be used in pastas and on pizzas.

“I like extra-firm tofu with tapenade and tomatoes. If you put extra-firm tofu through your food processor, it will come out the texture of ricotta cheese, and you can use it that way in lasagnas and other pasta dishes.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)





TOFU, FROZEN


Tips: Freezing firm or extra-firm tofu changes its texture. Once thawed and cooked, it has a chewy, meaty texture. Cubed, it approximates the texture of meat. Crumbled, it approximates the texture of ground beef.

Tip: Use when you’re looking for the softest texture.





TOFU, SCRAMBLED


Tips: Substitute crumbled firm or extra-firm tofu for scrambled eggs as a base to mix in vegetables and seasonings, e.g., avocados, bell peppers, black beans, cilantro, garlic, mushrooms, onions, parsley, scallions, spinach, tempeh bacon, tomatoes, or vegan sausage. Achieve the yellow hue of scrambled eggs via nutritional yeast or turmeric.





TOFU, SILKEN


Flavor: slightly sweet, with a creamy, moist, smooth, custard-like texture



Volume: quiet



Tips: Puree into sauces and soups to give them a creamy texture. Blend silken tofu with agave nectar and/or maple syrup plus vanilla for a vegan topping to enjoy on French toast, pancakes, or waffles—or on desserts. Do not substitute silken for regular tofu, or vice versa; use the type specified by the particular recipe.

“Tofu is so versatile! You can use it as a savory element to make a mousse or a veggie burger. If you marinate it, you can use it like a cheese and add it to salads. I add soy milk and silken tofu to polenta, then serve it with broccoli rabe. I like to marinate tofu with turmeric or with raw onion, sherry vinegar, red or green pepper, and soy sauce. Easiest of all is marinating a whole block of tofu in miso, then baking it for 20 minutes—it comes out with such a great flavor, and is even better with some brown rice and broccoli rabe.”

—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)




“Island Spring is the Cadillac of tofu. It takes time to develop a great product, and theirs is dense and flavorful and absorbs other flavors well.… I like to grill my tofu before marinating it, because citrus tears apart the fiber and makes it impossible to char afterward. Marinating grilled tofu pushes the flavor of the char and the marinade into the tofu.”

—MAKINI HOWELL, PLUM BISTRO (SEATTLE)




“Our spin on tuna with wasabi is spicy grilled tofu taken in a Korean direction with gochujang, which is the paste used in bibambap. The gochujang is a little sharp, so we add bean paste for a sweet balance that is turned into a glaze to finish the tofu.”

“I make my own smoked tofu after marinating tofu in tamari, sesame oil, and agave [nectar] and baking it. It doesn’t need more than 45 to 60 minutes in the smoker. I’ve added smoked tofu to spinach salad with orange-miso dressing.”

TRAIL MIX and TRAIL BARS


Tips: Use only unsalted raw nuts and unsweetened organic fruit. If nuts are roasted, opt for dry roasted rather than oil roasted.





“We make [trail] bars that combine unsulfured dried fruits, nuts, and spices to sweeten and spice a tasty blend of organic whole grains. Our top flavors are based on apricot, cashew, and turmeric; almond, cacao, and coconut; date, ginger, and sesame seeds; and cinnamon, prune, and walnut.”

TRUFFLES, AUSTRALIAN


Season: winter (in Australia, so they’re shipped to North America June–September)



Flavor: umami



Volume: moderate–loud



What they are: black truffles that have been cultivated in Australia since 1999



Tip: Use like other black truffles (see below).





“Australian black truffles are already the equal of other [e.g., French] black truffles in terms of aroma and flavor and continue to develop a stronger, longer-lasting flavor every year. Plus, it’s fun to use truffles in the summer [which is Australia’s winter]—their earthiness is an amazing complement to the sweetness of corn agnolotti.”

VEGGIE BURGERS


There are almost as many versions of veggie burgers as there are vegetarian chefs! Play with your favorite combination of whole grains, legumes, mushrooms, nuts, seeds, and/or vegetables to come up with your own.





“I developed a veggie burger from brown rice, chickpeas, lentils, and mushrooms for a restaurant project outside Mélisse—but I’ve used the same combination as a ‘sausage’ in a bean and portobello mushroom cassoulet. There’s no casing—the broken rice serves as the binder, and I wrap it in plastic wrap and steam it before finishing it in a pan to give it a crust.”

—JOSIAH CITRIN, MÉLISSE (SANTA MONICA)




“We serve three different veggie burgers. My favorite is the Follow Your Heart burger, which is a meatlike soy-based patty. My second favorite is the Nut Burger Supreme, which is based on nuts and vegetables and topped with lettuce, rennetless cheddar cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, sauerkraut, Vegenaise, and carrot shreds. It’s not a cohesive patty, but more like a pâté, that’s been heated on the grill so that it squeezes out as you take a bite. We also offer a Multi-Grain Mushroom burger, which is somewhat similar in texture to the nutburger and based on brown rice, wheat berries, barley, lentils, mushrooms, and herbs.”

VERJUS


[vair-ZHOO]



Flavor: sour/sweet, often with notes of fruit



Volume: varies, from quiet to moderate-loud



What it is: juice from unripe (i.e., low-sugar, high-acid) red or white grapes



Tips: Substitute white verjus for citrus (e.g., lemon, lime) and red verjus for red wine vinegar when looking to add a quieter acid to a dish or when looking to pair the dish with wine (as it’s more wine-friendly than vinegar). In general, opt for white verjus with quieter or lighter ingredients, and earthy red verjus with louder or darker ingredients. Look for verjus from American wineries coast to coast, e.g., Navarro (CA) to Wölffer Estate (NY), as well as the French producer Roland.

Calories: 25 (cider, wine)–100 (balsamic) per ½ cup



Tip: Can act as a flavor enhancer to many dishes



Possible substitutes: lemon juice, lime juice, tamarind paste, verjus, wine

VINEGAR, BALSAMIC


Flavor: sour/sweet, with great complexity, and a rich, slightly syrupy texture



Volume: moderate–loud



Tips: The best is aged, and expensive—but worth every penny. Balsamic vinegar can be used without oil as a low-fat dressing. Add it at the end of cooking (never boil!), or use it to finish a dish just before serving, especially when you want a sweet, low-acid vinegar. Opt for white balsamic vinegar (e.g., with grapeseed oil) when a lighter flavor (or color) is desired.

“Shojin cuisine [developed in Zen Buddhist monastaries] prohibits garlic, which has a strong, long-lasting flavor that can overpower other flavors, even affecting the flavor of the next course—or the next day! Wasabi is also strong, but its flavor evaporates quickly.”

Sommelier Pascaline Lepeltier of Rouge Tomate in New York City on Pairing Wine with Vegetarian and Vegan Dishes


Although we are not a vegetarian restaurant, the cuisine here is vegetable-focused. With meatless dishes, there is an incredible spectrum of aromas, tastes, and textures—from raw fennel to tomato-based dishes to grains and mushrooms. But with vegetables, 60 percent of the time, you’re talking about pairing with a white wine. To simplify things, think seasonally:

Spring / Summer: When there are lots of green vegetables—such as spring asparagus, fava beans, and peas—you’ll want to reach for aromatic wines with high acid, such as Sauvignon Blanc, Grüner Veltliner, dry Muscat, and Riesling. In summertime, you can add high-acid wines such as Assyrtiko, Muscadet (which is great with asparagus and artichokes, which are often wine killers), and Vouvray.

Autumn / Winter: When there are lots of root vegetables—such as turnips and parsnips—you’ll want to turn to wines with more richness and oxidation, such as white wines from the Rhone, including Viognier and Roussanne/Marsanne blends. Chardonnay with some malolactic and some oak and [slate-grown] Chenin will work here, too. I love Fiano from Italy at this time of year, or Pinot Grigio or wines from Friuli that have been made with some skin contact.



When you do want a red wine with vegetable dishes, we’re talking about a higher-acid, lower-tannin red wine, such as a lighter-bodied Pinot Noir, Gamay (e.g., Beaujolais), or Grenache.

When I pair wines with dishes, I think about two primary things: (1) Texture: How a dish is built—(is it soft, crunchy, chewy, or melting in your mouth?), and (2) Flavor: Taste (is it sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami?) plus Aroma.

When pairing with raw vegetables, there is typically a dressing of some kind—often lemon- or vinegar-based—to complement the crisp, bright, fresh flavors in the wine.

There are two main schools of thought: (1) Have the wine parallel a dish, so that it mimics it; or (2) have the wine balance the dish, so the wine brings something to the pairing. A few examples:

Green salad with herbs. This is always on the menu and is slightly bitter with a lemon vinaigrette, which gives an overall impression of freshness. So I’m looking for a fresh-tasting wine. Sauvignon Blanc is the obvious choice—but I like to play with different types. I’ve turned to Sauvignon Gris from Burgundy, which is more aromatic yet has the green notes of a Sauvignon Blanc plus the minerality of a Chablis. If you’re looking for a more adventurous or funky choice, I might turn to a dry Jurançon—a Manseng without oak, with a clean, herbal component.

Carrot salad with honey. This salad has a touch of sweetness from the carrots, which are roasted and poached and accented with honey, and has a very soft texture, so it’s almost melting in your mouth. The wine should have at least a hint of sweetness. I’m crazy about Chenin (Blanc), which can be slightly oily in texture while high in acid. Vouvray (which is made from Chenin Blanc) has a slightly vegetal character when it is young, and a touch of chamomile-like freshness, which is perfect with this.

Beet salad with pineapple. This is perfect with rosé, especially a Grenache-based rosé, which has a strawberry aspect and a sweeter and earthier profile. I’ve also paired this salad with a white wine from the Douro region of Portugal, made from Rabigato grapes. It’s rich and slightly off-dry, and similar to a Grenache Blanc, with its earthy tea and jasmine notes.

Potato/nettle soup. Because the base is potato, the soup is starchy and the texture is thick—plus it’s paired with an egg, which adds its own richness. So here, I want a wine that is rich and full-bodied, so higher in alcohol, to give the mouthfeel I’m looking for. I turn to a Juhfark from Hungary, which is similar to a Roussanne, but more aromatic and flinty.

“Zucchini shaved on a mandoline into pappardelle, and marinated in lime juice, olive oil, and salt, makes a very silky vegetable pasta. If it’s grilled when raw, it cooks unevenly and tends to turn to mush—but if you roast it first to al dente, and just flash it on the grill, it helps it maintain its integrity.”

CAFÉ GRATITUDE IN LOS ANGELES


“[The Flavor Bible] is a resource tool that I turn to time and time again.”

—ANGELA LIDDON, BLOGGER AND AUTHOR OF THE OH SHE GLOWS COOKBOOK




“[The Flavor Bible is] one of my three favorite non-cookbook books.”

—ROBIN ROBERTSON, AUTHOR OF MORE THAN TWENTY COOKBOOKS, INCLUDING VEGAN PLANET




“If you look on any professional chef’s bookshelf, chances are that Page and Dornenburg’s books are going to be there, battered and bruised, coffee stained and taped together at the spine. Why this place of pride? Because these books contain the most useful culinary lists ever assembled.”

—MICHAEL NATKIN, BLOGGER AND AUTHOR OF HERBIVORACIOUS



I am grateful for the warm support of the countless vegetarian and vegan writers whose appreciation of our work provided invaluable encouragement along this path.

I am grateful to all the chefs, restaurateurs, fellow authors, and other experts I interviewed, who were unfailingly generous in sharing their time and insights. Candle 79 co-owners Joy Pierson and Bart Potenza are so warm and welcoming that I felt as if I’d known them forever upon our first meeting, and Joy—a nutritionist by training—became an especially valuable sounding board.

I am grateful for the awe-inspiring work of three authors whose work has influenced me greatly. I am enormously grateful to Dr. T. Colin Campbell for making his Center for Nutrition Studies’ extraordinary certificate program in plant-based nutrition available through Cornell University; I found it nothing short of life-changing. I am grateful to Dr. Neal Barnard, whose articulate arguments helped me discover what I myself believe. And I am grateful to Dr. Joel Fuhrman for being responsible for my “seeing the light” about nutrient density, a concept that has helped me make more healthful food choices every day since.

My husband, Andrew (to whom I’m grateful for his extraordinarily beautiful photographs, and more), joins me in expressing gratitude to our family members and to new and old friends who were incredible sources of love, support, and friendship, especially Rosario Acquista, Ivan Askwith, Steve Beckta, Kristen Bell, Bill Bratton, Brian Burry, Susan Bulkeley Butler, John Carter, Ilene Cavagnuolo, Howard Childs, Maureen Cunningham, Julia D’Amico, Blake Davis, Julia Davis, Susan Davis, Laura Day, Samson Day, Susan Dey, Deborah Domanski, Jill Eikenberry, Ashley Garrett, Michael Gelb, Marketa Irglova, Alan Jones, my nutrition-obsessed bff Rikki Klieman, Brendan Milburn, Jody Oberfelder, Kelley Olson, Scott Olson, Cynthia Penney, Jeff Penney, Lynn Pike, Deborah Pines, Caroline Pires, Juergen Riehm, Stuart Rockefeller, Stephen Schiff, Tony Schwartz, Leslie Scott, Michael Tucker, Jane Umanoff, and Valerie Vigoda. Cynthia Penney provided invaluable editorial feedback, and we must also thank Shauna James Ahern, Joan Green, Tami Hardeman, Cameron Karger, Ellie Krieger, Teresa Schlanger, and Janos Wilder for their kindnesses.

I will be forever grateful to everyone on the extended Little, Brown team—with special, heartfelt thanks to my editor Michael Sand—who shared my passion for this book and for making it as good, true, and beautiful as possible, and who offered moral or other support along the way, including Reagan Arthur, Judy Clain, Nicole Dewey, Heather Fain, Peggy Freudenthal, Cathy Gruhn, Keith Hayes, Denise LaCongo, Garrett McGrath, Michael Pietsch, Kathryn Rogers, Andrea Shallcross, Rebecca Westall, and Jean Wilcox.

PHOTOGRAPHER’S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS


I am grateful to the author of this book for giving me my big break as a photographer. I am also grateful to her for writing such an epic book and giving me the opportunity to create images to help bring it to life, providing the countless hours of encouragement and support that I needed to accomplish this mission, and being the greatest wife on the planet all along the way. With all the love in the universe, I thank you, Karen.

I am grateful to the farmers who pour their hearts and souls into creating produce all across the country—from the North Fork of Long Island to the heartland of Chicago to the California coast—produce so beautiful that it was a privilege to photograph it. My very favorite is the Union Square Greenmarket in New York City (GrowNYC.org), with which—after buying the vast majority of the produce we’ve eaten over the past two years there—I have come to feel a sacred bond. Special thanks to Bobolink Dairy and Jonathan White; Bodhitree Farm and Nevia No; Greener Pastures; Lani’s Farm; Lucky Dog Farm and Richard Giles; Keith’s Farm; Migliorelli Farm; Queens County Farm Museum and Keha McIlwaine and Karen Jarman; S & S O Produce Farms; Violet Hill Farm; Windfall Farms; and W. Rogowski Farm and Andrzej Kurosz.

I am grateful to all of the restaurants that inspired me by creating beautiful plant-based dishes, including Betony, Candle 79 and both Candle Cafes, Café Gratitude, Cookbook, Crossroads, Dirt Candy, Dovetail, Downtown, Eleven Madison Park, FnB, Glenmere Mansion, Hotel Fauchère, The Inn at Little Washington (and Rachel Hayden), Kajitsu, Mélisse, Narcissa, Per Se, Picholine, The Point, Pomegranate Café, Rouge Tomate, Suenos, Table Verte, Tulsi, and Vedge.

I am grateful to Little, Brown editor Michael Sand for his keen eye and invaluable input on the photography for this book.

Finally, I am grateful to my talented photographer friend Howard (“I will be in Japan, but call me if you have a question”) Childs for never failing to offer encouragement, time, and advice.

ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER


Former restaurant chef Andrew Dornenburg grew up in San Francisco with a grandmother who had her own darkroom, and he inherited her love of photography and, later, his family’s camera equipment, which fueled his early experimentation. The culmination of a lifelong dream to unite his love of food with his passion for creating beautiful images, this is his first book as a photographer.

“The fact is that healthful eating consistently emphasizes the same foods: vegetables, fruits, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.”

—DR. DAVID KATZ, IN DISEASE-PROOF: THE REMARKABLE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT MAKES US WELL (2013)

“Seven of the top ten causes of death in 2010 were chronic diseases [such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity. Health risk behaviors that cause chronic diseases include poor nutrition.]… In 2011, more than one third (36%) of adolescents said they ate fruit less than once a day, and 38% said they ate vegetables less than once a day. In addition, 38% of adults said they ate fruit less than once a day, and 23% said they ate vegetables less than once a day.”

—NATIONAL CENTER FOR CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION (2014)

“It takes kids about twelve exposures to a taste to begin to like it. So it takes a while for them to get used to the idea that broccoli actually tastes good—and to admit that it does.”

—DR. MEHMET OZ, WHO HAS SAID ON OPRAH.COM THAT HE EATS VEGETARIAN AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE, LISA (A VEGETARIAN SINCE AGE 15)

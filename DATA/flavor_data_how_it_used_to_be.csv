Deviled Eggs with Curry Powder and Smoked Paprika

—The Library Bar at The Peacock (New York City)





Vegan Egg Substitutes


For breakfast, instead of scrambling eggs, “scramble” tofu (e.g., extra-firm) with herbs and/or vegetables. Firm tofu also replaces hard-boiled egg whites in vegan dishes (e.g., “egg salads”).


When baking, you can use Ener-G Egg Replacer, a potato starch–based product that can often replace eggs in the ratio of 1½ teaspoons Ener-G to 2 tablespoons water for each egg, or other commercial egg replacers. However, there are probably already egg replacers in your cupboard or refrigerator, as you’ll see below.


How to know which other substitute to use? First, determine whether its need is for binding (i.e., holding the mixture together, without the need to rise, e.g., casseroles, veggie burgers), leavening (i.e., by adding air bubbles to a batter or dough, as well-beaten eggs do, e.g., in baked goods such as breads, cakes, cupcakes, or muffins), or simply adding moisture.





Egg Substitutes, each equivalent to 1 egg (best use)


¼ cup applesauce (adding moisture, e.g., in brownies, cakes, cupcakes, quickbreads)

¼ cup avocado, mashed (binding)

1 teaspoon baking soda + 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (leavening and adding moisture)

½ mashed banana (adding moisture and/or binding, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)

¼ cup carbonated water (leavening)

1 tablespoon chia seed meal + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (adding moisture; for leavening, add ¼ teaspoon baking powder)

¼ cup full-fat coconut milk + 1 teaspoon baking powder (leavening, esp. in compatibly flavored dishes)

¼ cup dried fruit (e.g., apricot, prune) puree (adding moisture)

1 tablespoon ground flax seeds + 3 tablespoons water, mixed (binding; for leavening: add ¼ teaspoon baking powder, esp. in nut/seed-compatible dishes, e.g., whole-grain cookies, muffins, pancakes)

3 tablespoons nut butter, e.g., peanut (binding, e.g., grain-based veggie burgers)

¼ cup silken tofu, blended (adding moisture, esp. in heavier baked goods, e.g., brownies, carrot cakes)

¼ cup vegetable puree, e.g., beets, carrots, pumpkin (adding moisture)

¼ cup yogurt, dairy or nondairy (adding moisture, e.g., in cakes, muffins, pancakes, quick breads)



“We don’t cook with eggs, so I use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with baking powder to make my cakes rise. I’ve used Ener-G Egg Replacer when baking cookies. It has also worked surprisingly well in ‘meringues’ and looks beautiful.”

“Zucchini ‘noodles’ are soft and pliable—especially if blanched in lemon juice, which gives them a soft ‘cooked’ texture—making them the #1 raw pasta option. While using a spiralizer produces a more realistic noodle, using a mandoline is fine if you’re pressed for time.”

—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)





SPIRALING or SPIRALIZING


Use a spiral slicer to create “pasta” (e.g., “angel hair,” “linguini,” “spaghetti”) or thin ribbons out of hard vegetables (e.g., beets, carrots, celery root, daikon, jícama, kohlrabi, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, zucchini) or even fruits (e.g., apples). To soften, toss with a bit of oil and salt (or sauté very briefly) before saucing or adding to soup.


Possible substitutes: julienne peelers, mandolines





Dishes


Housemade Coconut Curry, Jícama Noodles, Garlic Chives, Ube, Roasted Shiitake

—Green Zebra (Chicago)





“I’ll use a spiralizer to make ‘noodles’ like vermicelli from raw kohlrabi or zucchini or other vegetables. Just massage them with a little oil and salt, and in just one minute, the noodles are no longer crunchy but chewy.”

—AMANDA COHEN, DIRT CANDY (NEW YORK CITY)




“Spiralized jícama looks like pho noodles. I’ll add them to a vegetarian pho [Vietnamese noodle soup], or a mushroom curry made with roasted shiitakes and purple sweet potatoes, with the red curry sauce poured tableside.”

Combine grain with the cooking liquid (e.g., water, stock) in a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid in the ratio indicated for the specific grain. Bring to a boil, add the grain, and bring to a boil again. Then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for the cooking time indicated.

—Arethusa Al Tavolo (Bantam, Connecticut)",,"Tips: Soak dried beans overnight (or for 8–10 hours) before cooking. Drain and rinse the beans before cooking in fresh water for about 1–3 hours, depending on the type of bean. While you can add alliums (e.g., garlic, onions) or herbs (e.g., parsley, thyme) during the cooking process, do not add acid (e.g., lemon, tomato, vinegar) during cooking; acids may interfere with the cooking process. If you don’t buy salt-free canned beans, rinse before using. Dried beans will typically yield three times their quantity in cooked beans (i.e., ⅓ cup dried beans = 1 cup cooked beans). Certain compatible seasonings also aid in the digestion of beans, e.g., asafoetida, cumin, fennel, ginger, kombu, savory.",,,,,,"Botanical relatives: lentils, peanuts, peas",,What they are: legumes,Brands: Eden,,

Chef Colin Bedford of North Carolina’s Fearrington House on Mushrooms


At the Fearrington House, we treat mushrooms very much like meat. We will take larger king oyster or maitake mushrooms and confit them whole in olive oil, or we will sous-vide them as that is another great technique to infuse flavor and to create layers of flavors. The flavors differ throughout the year. In March, we use thyme, garlic, and white wine, as the wine really brightens the flavor.

King Oysters are nice, big, fat mushrooms. We will confit them with garlic, bay leaf, and thyme. The ratio of stalk to cap is crazy—like 5 percent cap to 95 percent stalk, so we use the stalk for carpaccio, cooking the mushrooms at 85°C for one to one-and-a-half hours with lots of aromatics. Once they are cool, we slice them thin on a mandoline and lay them on the plate. With the dish, we add crosnes, which are like a really cool artichoke; sunchokes, roasted cippolini onions, and garlic chips for a crispy texture.

Maitake mushrooms are my favorite. They have a meaty quality and are so versatile. We will confit them whole. Sunchokes work really well with them, as does ginger, which gives it a warm, earthy tone—with fresh ginger adding heat, and candied ginger mellowing the flavor. I’ll also use sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup—we use Mikuni Wild Harvest’s NOBLE maple syrup.

Chanterelles are another favorite. Thyme is one of my favorite pairings, as is sage; I will use one or the other. In the fall or winter, black garlic also works well with them: We will caramelize and puree the garlic, which has a kind of fermented quality that brings up sweetness, and from there we will add some Madeira and maple [syrup] for more flavor. Chanterelles are a mushroom that we don’t cook to order. We like to cook them beforehand and stew them down with aromatics, butter, and just a pinch of white wine at the end to balance the flavors.

Matsutakes call for keeping it simple, so we don’t mess around with them too much, and simply confit them. After they are cooked, we will score and then pan sear them so you get that contrasting texture.

Doubloons are smaller than shiitake mushrooms, but we treat them the same way.





Pickling Mushrooms with Colin Bedford


Beech mushrooms are perfect for pickling, as they are essentially sponges. A cremini would be too hard; you would just get little nuggets. When pickling mushrooms, the pickling solution will depend on the season, which will influence our choice of vinegar—for example:

• Autumn: madeira and sherry vinegars

• Winter: port wine, red wine, and raspberry vinegars

• Spring: lemon and chardonnay vinegars

• Summer: white balsamic and champagne vinegars",,,,"Flavor Affinities

Tofu is solidified using nigari or lemon juice, so flavors that pair well with lemon often work beautifully. Rinse tofu in cold water before using, and drain well to better allow tofu to absorb seasonings. You can press out the excess water from tofu by using paper towels and heavy books or cans, but frequent tofu cooks might consider investing in a tofu press (e.g., TofuXpress).",,"Flavor Affinities

But food has to first satisfy taste, so the challenge is always to find the right combination of ingredients and balance of flavors and textures. I have been experimenting with grains and beans in nontraditional ways: folded into muffins, added to savory custards, and pulverized into tart crusts. This also allows me to bring energy-rich plant foods into our products replacing white flours and sugars, which are devoid of nutrition. Sprouted-grain flours are especially interesting to me because they offer not only great flavor, but also an energy-rich ingredient for baked goods.

Because my kitchen is focused on developing savory baked items, I try to create the flavors first and then select how they are best presented.

Chef Susan Feniger prefers using shredded and cooked jackfruit to processed faux meats in Street’s vegan dishes such as baos and tacos. She has found that jackfruit takes on whatever flavors it’s cooked with and even fools meat eaters. You’ll typically want to rinse, drain, and shred before using; alternatively, cut into bite-sized triangles, as you would pineapple. Jackfruit is the world’s largest tree fruit and can grow up to three feet long. Keep an eye out for products from Annie Ryu’s Global Village Fruits.",,"Flavor Affinities

Make Your Own Almond Milk


Diane Forley of Flourish Baking Company says it’s easy to make your own delicious almond milk by

soaking raw almonds overnight

draining them

combining soaked almonds with fresh water in a 1:3 ratio in a Vitamix

straining the milk through a fine-mesh nut milk bag

adding cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)



You can also cook down almond milk, adding a pinch of pectin, then chill, to create a yogurt-like almond cream to enjoy on its own or with berries, granola, etc.",Volume: moderate,"Tips: For a delicious vegan hot chocolate, melt bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, then blend with almond milk just until hot. Do not overheat, as almond milk will evaporate.",,"Flavor Affinities

Talking with Chef Chris Eddy of Winvian about Cooking for Vegetarians


One of my favorite dishes of 2013 was a simple vegetarian pappardelle dish I was served at Winvian, a unique Connecticut resort that houses eighteen individually designed cottages, including a helicopter and a treehouse. It featured a green sauce, along with sautéed cauliflower, mushrooms, and onions, and a very light dusting of grated cheese on top. The creamy sauce turned out to be a steamed broccoli puree made in a Vitamix with a bit of ice (“to cool the broccoli as quickly as possible,” according to chef Chris Eddy), some clear vegetable stock (“so as not to interfere with the beautiful green color”), a hint of heat in the form of either cayenne or chili pepper flakes (“always—it’s a ‘calling card’ that leaves an impression even after you’ve finished eating”), and just a touch of brown butter (“to add an amazing dimension to the sauce”). It’s based on a “ridiculously simple” technique Eddy learned while working with Chef Alain Ducasse and, I can attest, it’s ridiculously delicious.

Eddy says the technique works just as well with other vegetables—whether cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, or parsnips—and if added richness is desired, one could substitute cream for some of the clear vegetable stock (“although its whiteness fades the bright colors”), though the dish is creamy and rich even without added cream.

While Eddy characterizes Winvian’s customers as about 35 to 40 percent pescetarian, he and chef de cuisine Patrick Espinoza and their kitchen team spent a month eating vegetarian during the summer of 2013, just for the experience of putting themselves into the shoes of the significant portion of Winvian’s clientele (“about 7 or 8 percent of our customers”) who eat vegetarian. Why? “Number one, we love vegetables,” Eddy admits. But out of compassion for Winvian’s vegetarian customers, “We wanted to ‘feel their pain.’ We came to understand their frustration [at other restaurants] of only being offered the same dishes again and again—whether eggplant Parmesan, or risotto, or a salad—when they went out to dine.” In addition to prompting Eddy and his team to come up with an ever-changing array of dishes like the incredible pappardelle I fell in love with, their month-long vegetarian experiment had an added bonus: a number of Eddy’s cooks discovered that they felt healthier and sometimes less irritable.

“Now, we like to go all out for our vegetarian guests, and give them something special,” says Eddy. Mission accomplished.",,"Tips: There are more whole-grain varieties than ever, including brown rice, buckwheat, corn, oat, quinoa, rice, spelt, whole-wheat, etc. Experiment with various shapes, e.g., penne, rotini, shells, etc.","Possible substitutes: spiralized vegetables (e.g., zucchini) instead of linguini, spaghetti, etc.; sliced vegetables (e.g., eggplant, summer squash, sweet potato) instead of lasagna noodles",,Nutritional profile: 81% carbs / 15% protein / 4% fats,"Calories: 175 per 1-cup serving (whole-wheat spaghetti, cooked)",,,Protein: 7 grams,,,,
